About Introduction to Python Pr ogramming
Introduction to Python Pr ogramming provides a compr ehensive foundation in pr ogramming concepts and
skills, and is aligned to the scope of most intr oductory courses. A wide arr ay of scenarios, conte xts, and
problems r eflect pr ogramming applications in many disciplines and car eers. The offering is suitable for a
diverse learner audience, including those pursuing computer science, business, science, social science,
statistics, data science, and r elated ar eas of study and emplo yment.Preface 1
Introduction to Python Pr ogramming is an inter active offering that teaches basic pr ogramming concepts,
problem-solving skills, and the Python language using hands-on activities. The r esour ce includes a unique,
integr ated code runner , through which students can immediately apply what the y learn to check their
understanding. Embedded videos, critical thinking e xercises, and e xplor ations of e xternal pr ogramming tools
and activities all contribute to a meaningful and supportive learning e xperience.
The content is or ganized in chapters, with each chapter containing 6-8 sections. Each section follo ws the
pattern:
•Learning objectives
•1–3 subsections
•Programming pr actice
The learning objectives ar e designed to help r eaders identify the section 's focus. Each objective completes the
sentence, "By the end of this section you should be able to ". The pr ogramming pr actice aligns with the
learning objectives and gives r eaders an opportunity to apply concepts learned in the section.
Pedagogical Foundation
Concise te xt and video-based animations
Introduction to Python Pr ogramming is designed to foster active learning and student engagement. It focuses
on inter activity and pr actice thr ough its integr ated code runner , videos, and links to e xternal envir onments and
activities. With that focus, the material is often mor e concise, with less te xt and mor e activity .
Each section 's content is or ganized in subsections. The subsection begins with a concise intr oduction to the
concept, with ke y term definitions and brief conte xt for its r elevance and importance. The concept is then
explained in detail using video-based animations and inter active learning questions.
Animation videos use a step-b y-step appr oach to sho w the e xecution of Python code. Explanations for each
step describe Python syntax, sho w ho w fundamental pr ogramming concepts ar e used, illustr ate ho w variables
are assigned, emphasize ho w code e xecutes line b y line, apply pr oblem solving to cr eate pr ograms, and mor e.

Learning questions
After intr oducing a ne w concept and e xplaining the concept with a video-based animation, each subsection
includes engagement in the form of learning questions. These questions r einfor ce the concepts taught,
explain concepts in mor e depth, dir ectly addr ess misconceptions and err ors commonly made b y new
programmers, and teach r elated concepts.
Explanations ar e provided for the incorr ect answers. Incorr ect answers' e xplanations include why the answer is
incorr ect and help guide the r eader to the corr ect answer .
Incorr ect answer choices typically r epresent a misconception or ar e the r esult of making a common mistake.
Even if the corr ect answer is achie ved, r eaders ar e encour aged to e xplor e the e xplanations to gain awar eness
of these common misconceptions.
Programming pr actice e xercises
Each section ends with 1 or 2 pr actice pr ograms. This book includes an integr ated pr ogramming envir onment,
known as the "OpenStax Python Code Runner ," which allo ws readers to write pr ograms dir ectly in the br owser .2Preface

Introduction
Computers and pr ograms ar e everywher e in today 's world. Pr ograms affect many aspects of daily life and
society as a whole. People depend on pr ograms for communication, shopping, entertainment, health car e, and
countless other needs. Learning ho w to pr ogram computers opens the door to many car eers and
opportunities for building a better world.
Programs consist of statements to be run one after the other . Astatement describes some action to be
carried out.
The statement print("Good morning" )instructs Python to output the message "Good morning" to the
user. The statement count = 0instructs Python to assign the integer 0to the variable count.
This chapter intr oduces statements for input and output, assigning variables, and basic arithmetic. Making
mistakes is a normal part of pr ogramming, and the chapter includes advice on understanding err or messages.
The chapter ends with a short history of Python and discusses why Python has become so popular today .

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section you should be able to
•Name two e xamples of computer pr ograms in e veryday life.
•Explain why Python is a good pr ogramming language to learn.
Computer pr ograms
Acomputer is an electr onic de vice that stor es and pr ocesses information. Examples of computers include
smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktops, and servers. T echnically , aprogramis a sequence of instructions that
a computer can run. Pr ograms help people accomplish e veryday tasks, cr eate ne w technology , and have fun.
The goal of this book is to teach intr oductory pr ogramming and pr oblem solving. W riting pr ograms is a
creative activity , inher ently useful, and r ewarding! No prior backgr ound in computer science is necessary to
read this book. Many differ ent types of pr ograms e xist, as sho wn in the illustr ation belo w. This book will focus
on gener al purpose pr ograms that typically run "behind the scenes."

EXPL ORING FUR THER
Later chapters of this book sho w ho w to write analysis pr ograms using r eal data. Example libr aries that
provide access to online str eaming services include Spotip y(https://openstax.or g/r/100spotip y),Pytube
(https://openstax.or g/r/100p ytube) , and Pydor a(https://openstax.or g/r/100p ydor a). Python-r elated tools
often have the letters " py" in their name.
The Python language
This book intr oduces Python (https://openstax.or g/r/100p ython) , one of the top pr ogramming languages
today . Leading tech giants like Google, Apple, NASA, Instagr am, Pixar , and others use Python e xtensively .
One r eason why Python is popular is because many libr aries e xist for doing r eal work. A libraryis a collection
of code that can be used in other pr ograms. Python comes with an e xtensive Standar d Libr ary
(https://openstax.or g/r/100p ythlibr ary) for solving e veryday computing pr oblems like e xtracting data fr om files
and cr eating summary r eports. In addition, the community de velops many other libr aries for Python. Ex:
Pandas (https://openstax.or g/r/100pandas) is a widely used libr ary for data analysis.
Another r eason why Python is popular is because the syntax is concise and str aightforwar d. The syntax of a
language defines ho w code must be structur ed. Syntax rules define the ke ywor ds, symbols, and formatting
used in pr ograms. Compar ed to other pr ogramming languages, Python is mor e concise and str aightforwar d.
EXAMPLE 1.1
Hello world in P ython and Ja va
By tr adition, Hello W orld (https://openstax.or g/r/100hello world) is the first pr ogram to write when learning
a ne w language. This pr ogram simply displays the message "Hello, World!" to the user . The hello world
program is only one line in Python:
print("Hello, World!" )
In contr ast, the hello world pr ogram is five lines in Java (a differ ent language).
public class Hello {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
}
However, conciseness is not the only consider ation for which language is used. In differ ent situations
differ ent languages may be mor e appr opriate. Ex: Java is often used in Andr oid de velopment.

Spaces and ne wline char acters ar e not inher ently important. Ho wever, learning to be pr ecise is an essential
skill for pr ogramming. Noticing little details, like ho w wor ds ar e separ ated and ho w lines end, helps ne w
programmers become better .
Basic input
Computer pr ograms often r eceive input fr om the user .Input is what a user enters into a pr ogram. An input
statement, variable = input("prompt" ), has thr ee parts:
1.Avariable refers to a value stor ed in memory . In the statement abo ve,variable can be r eplaced with any
name the pr ogrammer chooses.
2.The input() function r eads one line of input fr om the user . A function is a named, r eusable block of code
that performs a task when called. The input is stor ed in the computer 's memory and can be accessed later
using the variable.
3.Aprompt is a short message that indicates the pr ogram is waiting for input. In the statement abo ve,
"prompt "can be omitted or r eplaced with any message.

Assignment statement
Variables allo w pr ograms to r efer to values using names r ather than memory locations. Ex: agerefers to a
person 's age, and birthrefers to a person 's date of birth.
A statement can set a variable to a value using the assignment oper ator (=). Note that this is differ ent fr om
the equal sign of mathematics. Ex: age =6orbirth = "May 15" . The left side of the assignment statement
is a variable, and the right side is the value the variable is assigned.

Variable naming rules
A variable name can consist of letters, digits, and underscor es and be of any length. The name cannot start
with a digit. Ex: 101class is invalid. Also, letter case matters. Ex: Totalis differ ent fr omtotal. Python 's style
guide r ecommends writing variable names in snake case , which is all lo wercase with underscor es in between
each wor d, such as first_name ortotal_price .
A name should be short and descriptive, so wor ds ar e preferr ed o ver single char acters in pr ograms for
readability . Ex: A variable named countindicates the variable 's purpose better than a variable named c.
Python has r eserved wor ds, kno wn as keywor ds, which have special functions and cannot be used as names
for variables (or other objects).
False await else import pass
None break except in raise
True class finally is return
and continue for lambda try

1.6 Error messages
Learning objectives
By the end of this section you should be able to
•Identify the err or type and line number in err or messages.
•Corr ect syntax err ors, name err ors, and indentation err ors.
How to r ead err ors
A natur al part of pr ogramming is making mistakes. Even e xperienced pr ogrammers make mistakes when
writing code. Err ors may r esult when mistakes ar e made when writing code. The computer r equir es very
specific instructions telling the computer what to do. If the instructions ar e not clear , then the computer does
not kno w what to do and gives back an err or.
When an err or occurs, Python displays a message with the follo wing information:
1.The line number of the err or.
2.The type of err or (Ex: SyntaxError ).
3.Additional details about the err or.
Ex: T yping print"Hello!" without par entheses is a syntax err or. In Python, par entheses ar e requir ed to use
print. When attempting to run print"Hello!" , Python displays the follo wing err or:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/student/Desktop/example.py", line 1
print "Hello"
^
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print("Hello")?
The car et char acter ( ^) sho ws wher e Python found the err or. Sometimes the err or may be located one or two
lines befor e wher e the car et symbol is sho wn because Python may not have disco vered the err or until then.
Traceback is a Python r eport of the location and type of err or. The wor d traceback suggests a pr ogrammer
trace back in the code to find the err or if the err or is not seen right away .
Learning to r ead err or messages car efully is an important skill. The amount of technical jar gon can be
overwhelming at first. But this information can be very helpful.

Learning objectives
By the end of this section you should be able to
•Write concise, meaningful comments that e xplain intended functionality of the code.
•Write a docstring (mor e verbose comment) that describes the pr ogram functionality .
The hash char acter
Comments are short phr ases that e xplain what the code is doing. Ex: Lines 1, 8, and 10 in the follo wing
program contain comments. Each comment begins with a hash char acter ( #). All te xt from the hash char acter
to the end of the line is ignor ed when running the pr ogram. In contr ast, hash char acters inside of strings ar e
treated as r egular te xt. Ex: The string "Item #1: " does not contain a comment.
When writing comments:
•The #char acter should be follo wed b y a single space. Ex: # End of menu is easier to r ead than #End of
menu.
•Comments should e xplain the purpose of the code, not just r epeat the code itself . Ex: # Get the user's
preferences is mor e descriptive than # Input item1 and item2 .1.7 • Comments 27

Documentation
Python pr ograms may optionally begin with a string kno wn as a docstring. A docstring is documentation
written for others who will use the pr ogram but not necessarily r ead the sour ce code. Most of the official
documentation at docs.p ython.or g(https://openstax.or g/r/100docstrings) is gener ated fr om docstrings.
Documentation can be long, so docstrings ar e gener ally written as multi-line strings ("""). Common
elements of a docstring include a one-line summary , a blank line, and a longer description.

Learning objectives
By the end of this section you should be able to
•Name two historical facts about ho w Python was first cr eated.
•Describe two ways Python is consider ed a popular language.
Historical backgr ound
Python has an inter esting history . In 1982, Guido van Rossum (https://openstax.or g/r/100vanRossum) , the
creator of Python, started working at CWI (https://openstax.or g/r/100CWI) , a Dutch national r esear ch institute.
He joined a team that was designing a ne w pr ogramming language, named ABC, for teaching and pr ototyping.
ABC' s simplicity was ideal for beginners, but the language lacked featur es requir ed to write advanced
programs.
Several years later , van Rossum joined a differ ent team at CWI working on an oper ating system. The team
needed an easier way to write pr ograms for monitoring computers and analyzing data. Languages common in
the 1980' s wer e (and still ar e) difficult to use for these kinds of pr ograms. van Rossum envisioned a ne w
language that would have a simple syntax, like ABC, but also pr ovide advanced featur es that pr ofessionals
would need.
At first, van Rossum started working on this ne w language as a hobb y during his fr ee time. He named the
language Python because he was a fan of the British comedy gr oup Monty Python (https://openstax.or g/r/
100MontyPython) . Over the ne xt year , he and his colleagues successfully used Python many times for r eal
work. van Rossum e ventually decided to shar e Python with the br oader pr ogramming community online. He
freely shar ed Python 's entir e sour ce code so that anyone could write and run Python pr ograms.
Python 's first r elease, kno wn as V ersion 0.9.0, appear ed in 1991, about six years after C++ and four years
befor e Java. van Rossum 's decisions to make the language simple yet advanced, suitable for e veryday tasks,
and fr eely available online contributed to Python 's long-term success.

Popularity of Python
Over the years, Python has become a nonpr ofit or ganization with a thriving community . Millions of
programmers ar ound the world use Python for all kinds of inter esting pr ojects. Hundr eds of thousands of
Python libr aries have been r eleased as open sour ce softwar e. The Python community is very active and
supportive online, answering questions and sharing code.
One way to see Python 's popularity is the TIOBE inde x(https://openstax.or g/r/100TIOBE) . TIOBE is a Dutch
company that pr ovides pr oducts and services for measuring softwar e code quality . Since 2001, TIOBE has
tracked the popularity of pr ogramming languages and posted the r esults online. Figur e 1.2 shows the TIOBE
inde x over time for five of the most popular languages.
The TIOBE inde x is based on the number of sear ch engine r esults for each language. The per centage r efers to
how many r esults belong to that language. Python has been among the top 10 languages e very year since
2004. In October 2021, Python became the #1 language on the TIOBE inde x. No other language but C and Java
had been #1 for the pr evious 20 years.
Another way to see Python 's popularity is to analyze ho w frequently Python is discussed online. Stack Overflo w
(https://openstax.or g/r/100o verflo w)is a question-and-answer website for pr ogrammers. Figur e 1.3 shows the

•print()and input().
•Variables and assignment.
•Strings, integers, and floats.
•Arithmetic, concatenation.
•Common err or messages.
•Comments and docstrings.
At this point, you should be able to write pr ograms that ask for input, perform simple calculations, and output
the r esults. The pr ogramming pr actice belo w ties together most topics pr esented in the chapter .

Introduction
A computer pr ogram is a sequence of statements that run one after the other . In Python, many statements
consist of one or mor e expressions. An expression represents a single value to be computed. Ex: The
expression 3*x -5evaluates to 7when xis4. Learning to r ecognize e xpressions opens the door for
programming all kinds of inter esting calculations.
Expr essions ar e often a combination of liter als, variables, and oper ators. In the pr evious e xample, 3and 5are
literals,xis a variable, and *and -are oper ators. Expr essions can be arbitr arily long, consisting of many
calculations. Expr essions can also be as short as one value. Ex: In the assignment statement x =5, the liter al
5is an e xpression.
The Statements chapter intr oduced simple e xpressions like 1*2and "Hi "+"there". This chapter
explor es other kinds of e xpressions for working with numbers and strings. The first section sho ws a gr eat way
to experiment with e xpressions using a Python shell. Later sections pr esent mor e details about integers and
floating-point numbers, e xplain ho w to import and use the mathmodule, and sho w ho w to make long lines of
code easier to r ead.

Learning objectives
By the end of this section you should be able to
•Use a Python shell to run statements and e xpressions inter actively .
•Explain the function of the up and do wn arr ow ke yboar d shortcuts.
The interpr eter
Python is a high-le vel language, meaning that the sour ce code is intended for humans to understand.
Computers, on the other hand, understand only lo w-level machine code made up of 1' s and 0' s. Pr ograms
written in high-le vel languages must be tr anslated into machine code to run. This tr anslation pr ocess can
happen all at once, or a little at a time, depending on the language.
Python is an interpr eted language: the sour ce code is tr anslated one line at a time while the pr ogram is
running. The Python interpr eter translates sour ce code into machine code and runs the r esulting pr ogram. If
and when an err or occurs, the interpr eter stops tr anslating the sour ce code and displays an err or message.
Most de velopment envir onments include a Python shell for e xperimenting with code inter actively . Ashell , also
called a console or terminal, is a pr ogram that allo ws dir ect inter action with an interpr eter. The interpr eter
usually runs an entir e program all at once. But the interpr eter can run one line of code at a time within a
Python shell.

results, and then try something else. When an err or occurs, an err or message is displayed, but the pr ogram
keeps running. That way , the user can edit the pr evious line and corr ect the err or inter actively .
The acr onym REPL (pr onounced " rep ul") is often used when r eferring to a shell. REPL stands for " read-e val-
print loop," which describes the r epetitive natur e of a shell:
1.Read/input some code
2.Evaluate/run the code
3.Print any r esults
4.Loop back to step 1
Most shells maintain a history of e very line of code the user types. Pr essing the up or do wn arr ow ke y on the

Implicit type conversion
Common oper ations update a variable such that the variable 's data type needs to be changed. Ex: A GPS first
assigns distance with 250, an integer . After a wr ong turn, the GPS assigns distance with 252.5, a float. The
Python interpr eter uses implicit type conversion to automatically convert one data type to another . Once
distance is assigned with 252.5, the interpr eter will convert distance from an integer to a float without the
programmer needing to specify the conversion.

By the end of this section you should be able to
•Identify the data types pr oduced b y oper ations with integers, floats, and strings.

Combining integers and floats
Programmers often need to combine numbers of differ ent data types. Ex: A pr ogram computes the total for an
online shopping or der:
quantity = int(input())
price = float(input())
total = quantity * price
print(total)
quantity is an integer , and priceis a float. So what is the data type of total? For input 3and 5.0,totalis2.3 • Mix ed data types 45

Combining an integer and a float pr oduces a float. A float is b y default printed with at least one figur e after the
decimal point and has as many figur es as needed to r epresent the value. Note: Division using the /oper ator
always pr oduces a float.

2.4 Floating-point err ors
Learning objectives
By the end of this section you should be able to
•Explain numerical inaccur acies r elated to floating-point r epresentation.
•Use the round()function to mitigate floating-point err ors in output.
Floating-point err ors
Computers stor e information using 0' s and 1' s. All information must be converted to a string of 0' s and 1' s. Ex:
5 is converted to 101. Since only two values, 0 or 1, ar e allo wed the format is called binary .
Floating-point values ar e stor ed as binary b y Python. The conversion of a floating point number to the
underlying binary r esults in specific types of floating-point err ors.
Around-off err oroccurs when floating-point values ar e stor ed err oneously as an appr oximation. The
differ ence between an appr oximation of a value used in computation and the corr ect (true) value is called a
round-off err or.
Ex: Storing the float (0.1) 10results in binary values that actually pr oduce

Floating point r ound() function
Python 'sround() function is used to r ound a floating-point number to a given number of decimal places. The
function r equir es two ar guments. The first ar gument is the number to be r ounded. The second ar gument
decides the number of decimal places to which the number is r ounded. If the second ar gument is not

2.5 Dividing integers
Learning objectives
By the end of this section you should be able to
•Evaluate e xpressions that involve floor division and modulo.
•Use the modulo oper ator to convert between units of measur e.
Division and modulo
Python pr ovides two ways to divide numbers:
•True division (/) converts numbers to floats befor e dividing. Ex: 7/4becomes 7.0/4.0, resulting in
1.75.
•Floor division (//) computes the quotient, or the number of times divided. Ex: 7//4is1because 4 goes
into 7 one time, r emainder 3. The modulo oper ator (%) computes the r emainder . Ex: 7%4is3.
Note: The %oper ator is tr aditionally pr onounced " mod" (short for " modulo "). Ex: When r eading 7%4out loud,
a programmer would say " seven mod four ."

Unit conversions
Division is useful for converting one unit of measur e to another . To convert centimeters to meters, a variable is
divided b y 100. Ex: 300 centimeters divided b y 100 is 3 meters.
Amounts often do not divide e venly as integers. 193 centimeters is 1.93 meters, or 1 meter and 93
centimeters. A pr ogram can use floor division and modulo to separ ate the units:
•The quotient, 1 meter , is193//100.
•The r emainder , 93 centimeters, is 193%100.
Programs often use floor division and modulo together . If one line of code floor divides b ym, the ne xt line will
likely modulo b ym. The unit mby which an amount is divided is called the modulus . Ex: When converting
centimeters to meters, the modulus is 100.

Arriv al time
Having a mobile de vice can be a lifesaver on long r oad trips. Pr ograms like Google Maps find the shortest
route and estimate the time of arrival. The time of arrival is based on the curr ent time plus ho w long the
trip will take.
Write a pr ogram that (1) inputs the curr ent time and estimated length of a trip, (2) calculates the time of
arrival, and (3) outputs the r esults in hours and minutes. Y our pr ogram should use the follo wing pr ompts
(user input in bold):

Current minute (0-59)? 25
Trip time (in minutes)? 340
Current hour (0-23)? 13
Current minute (0-59)? 25
Trip time (in minutes)? 340
In this e xample, the curr ent time is 13:25 (1:25pm). The trip time is 340 minutes (5 hours and 40 minutes).
340 minutes after 13:25 is 19:05 (7:05pm). Y our pr ogram should output the r esult in this format:
Arrival hour is19
Arrival minute is5
The arrival hour must be between 0 and 23. Ex: Adding 120 minutes to 23:00 should be 1:00, not 25:00. The
arrival minute must be between 0 and 59. Ex: Adding 20 minutes to 8:55 should be 9:15, not 8:75.

•Use functions and constants defined in the math module.
Importing modules
Python comes with an e xtensive standar d libr ary(https://openstax.or g/r/100p ythlibr ary) of modules. A
module is pr eviously written code that can be imported in a pr ogram. The import statement defines a
variable for accessing code in a module. Import statements often appear at the beginning of a pr ogram.
The standar d libr ary also defines built-in functions such as print(),input(), and float(). Abuilt-in
function is always available and does not need to be imported. The complete list of built-in functions
(https://openstax.or g/r/100builtin) is available in Python 's official documentation.
A commonly used module in the standar d libr ary is the math module (https://openstax.or g/r/
100mathmodule) . This module defines functions such as sqrt()(squar e root). T o call sqrt(), a pr ogram
must importmathand use the r esulting mathvariable follo wed b y a dot. Ex: math.sqrt( 25)evaluates to
5.0.

2.7 Formatting code
Learning objectives
By the end of this section you should be able to
•Identify good spacing for e xpressions and statements.
•Write multi-line statements using implicit line joining.
Recommended spacing
Most spaces in Python code ar e ignor ed when running pr ograms; ho wever, spaces at the start of a line ar e very
important. The follo wing two pr ograms ar e equivalent:
•Good spacing:
name =input("Enter someone's name: " )
place = input("Enter a famous place: " )
print(name, "should visit" , place + "!")
•Poor spacing:
name=input("Enter someone's name: " )
place =input("Enter a famous place: " )
print( name, "should visit" , place+ "!")
One might ar gue that missing or e xtra spaces do not matter . After all, the two pr ograms abo ve run e xactly the
same way . However, the " poor spacing" version is mor e difficult to r ead. Code like name=inputand place+
might lead to confusion.
Good pr ogrammers write code that is as easy to r ead as possible. That way , other pr ogrammers ar e mor e
likely to understand the code. T o encour age consistency , the Python community has a set of guidelines about
wher e to put spaces and blank lines, what to name variables, ho w to br eak up long lines, and other important
topics.

Automatic concatenation
Long strings make Python pr ograms difficult to r ead. Ex: This pr ogram prints the first sentence of the US
Declar ation of Independence (https://openstax.or g/r/100declar ation) :
print(" The unanimous Declar ation of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human
events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with
another , and to assume among the po wers of the earth, the separ ate and equal station to which the Laws of
Natur e and of Natur e's God entitle them, a decent r espect to the opinions of mankind r equir es that the y
should declar e the causes which impel them to the separ ation.")
PEP 8 r ecommends that each line of code be less than 80 char acters long. That way , programmers won 't need
to scr oll horizontally to r ead the code. The abo ve pr ogram can be r ewritten b y breaking up the original string:
print("The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of "
"America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes "
"necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands "
"which have connected them with another, and to assume among "
"the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to "
"which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a "
"decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they "
"should declare the causes which impel them to the separation." )

Multi-line statements
Most statements in a Python pr ogram need only one line of code. But occasionally longer statements need to
span multiple lines. Python pr ovides two ways to write multi-line statements:
•Explicit line joining, using \char acters:
decl ="The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of " \
"America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes " \
"necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands..."
•Implicit line joining, using par entheses:
decl = ( "The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of "
"America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes "
"necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands..." )
Implicit line joining is mor e common, since many statements and e xpressions use par entheses anyway . PEP 8
recommends avoiding the use of e xplicit line joining whene ver possible.

Introduction
Anobject is a single unit of data in a Python pr ogram. So far , this book has intr oduced thr ee types of objects:
strings, integers, and floats. This chapter takes a closer look at ho w strings ar e represented and ho w integers
and floats can be formatted. T o better understand what an object actually is, the r elationship between
variables and objects is emphasized. The chapter also intr oduces two types of containers: lists and tuples. A
container is an object that can hold an arbitr ary number of other objects. At the end of this chapter , you will
be able to solve mor e comple x problems using fe wer variables.

Unicode
Python uses Unicode , the international standar d for r epresenting te xt on computers. Unicode defines a
unique number , called a code point , for each possible char acter . Ex: "P"has the code point 80, and "!"has
the code point 33.
The built-in ord()function converts a char acter to a code point. Ex: ord("P")returns the integer 80.
Similarly , the built-in chr()function converts a code point to a char acter . Ex: chr(33)returns the string "!".
Unicode is an e xtension of ASCII , the American Standar d Code for Information Inter change. Originally , ASCII

Hopper quote
Grace Hopper (https://openstax.or g/r/100gr acehopper) (1906–1992) was a famous computer scientist (and
rear admir al in the US Navy!) who came up with the idea of machine-independent pr ogramming languages.
She envisioned a pr ogramming language based on English and made many contributions that paved the
way for modern pr ogramming languages, including Python.
Write a pr ogram that prints the follo wing te xt, including the quotation marks. Y our pr ogram may not use
single quotes (') anywher e in the code. The last line must be indented with a tab char acter .
"To me programming is more than an important practical art.
It is also a gigantic undertaking in the foundations of knowledge."

Shift cipher
During the Roman Empir e, Julius Caesar (100–44 BCE) used a simple technique to encrypt private
messages. Each letter of the message was r eplaced with the thir d ne xt letter of the alphabet. Ex: If the
message was CA T, the C became F , the A became D , and the T became W , resulting in the message FD W.
This technique is kno wn as a shift cipher because each letter is shifted b y some amount. In Caesar 's case,3.1 • Strings r evisited 75
the amount was thr ee, but other amounts (besides 0) would work too.
Write a pr ogram that pr ompts the user to input the follo wing two values (e xample input in bold):
Enter a 3-letter word: CAT
Shift by how many letters? 3
The pr ogram should then shift each letter of the wor d by the desir ed amount. Based on the e xample abo ve,
the output would be:
The secret message is: FDW
Hint: Use the ord()function to convert each letter to an integer , add the shift amount to each integer , use
thechr()function to convert each integer to a char acter , and concatenate the r esulting char acters.

Formatting numbers
Programs often need to display numbers in a specific format. Ex: When displaying the time, minutes ar e
formatted as two-digit integers. If the hour is 9 and the minute is 5, then the time is "9:05" (not "9:5").
In an f-string, a r eplacement field may include a format specifier intr oduced b y a colon. A format specifier
defines ho w a value should be formatted for display . Ex: In the string f"{hour}:{minute:02d} ", the format
specifier for minuteis02d.

•An object 'sidentity is a unique integer associated with the object. Gener ally, this integer r efers to the
memory location wher e the object is stor ed. Once cr eated, an object 's identity ne ver changes. The built-in
id()function r eturns the object 's identity .
•An object 'stype determines the possible values and oper ations of an object. Ex: Integers and floats can be
"divided" using the /oper ator, but strings cannot. The built-in type()function r eturns the object 's type.
•An object 'svalue represents the curr ent state of the object. Many objects, such as numbers and strings,
cannot be modified once cr eated. Some objects, such as lists (intr oduced later), ar e designed to be
modified.

EXPL ORING FUR THER
As sho wn in a memory diagr am, variables and objects ar e two separ ate ideas. Calling a function like id()
ortype()returns information about an object, not a variable. In fact, a variable doesn 't have an identity or
a type, as sho wn in this e xample:
>>> rating = 10 # Integer object somewhere in memory.
>>> type(rating)
<class 'int'>
>>> id(rating)
9793344
>>> rating = "ten" # String object somewhere else in memory.
>>> type(rating)
<class 'str'>
>>> id(rating)
140690967388272
One might incorr ectly think that the r ating variable 's type or identity changes. Ho wever, the only thing that
changes is which object the r ating variable r efers to.

Learning objectives
By the end of this section you should be able to
•Use inde xes to access individual elements in a list.
•Use inde xes to modify individual elements in a list.
•Use len()function to find the length of a list.
•Demonstr ate that lists can be changed after cr eation.
Lists
A list object can be used to bundle elements together in Python. A list is defined b y using squar e brackets []
with comma separ ated values within the squar e brackets. Ex: list_1 = [ 1,2,4].
Empty lists can be defined in two ways:
•list_1 = []
•list_1 = list()
Lists can be made of elements of any type. Lists can contain integers, strings, floats, or any other type. Lists
can also contain a combination of types. Ex: [2,"Hello",2.5]is a valid list.
Python lists allo w pr ogrammers to change the contents of the list in various ways.

a.my_list = [ 2,23,23]
b.my_list = [ "Jimmy",2,"times"]
c.my_list = [ "C","C++","Python" ,"Java","Rust","Scala"]
Using inde xes
Individual list elements can be accessed dir ectly using an inde x. Inde xes begin at 0 and end at one less than
the length of the sequence. Ex: For a sequence of 50 elements, the first position is 0, and the last position is 49.
The inde x number is put in squar e brackets []and attached to the end of the name of the list to access the
requir ed element. Ex: new_list[ 3]accesses the 4th element in new_list . An e xpression that e valuates to an
integer number can also be used as an inde x. Similar to strings, negative inde xing can also be used to addr ess
individual elements. Ex: Inde x -1 r efers to the last element and -2 the second-to-last element.
The len()function, when called on a list, r eturns the length of the list.
EXAMPLE 3.1

The follo wing code demonstr ates the use of list inde xes and the len()function. Line 6 sho ws the use of the

The Python interpr eter follo ws a single path of e xecution when e xecuting a pr ogram. What if a pr ogrammer
wants to define multiple possible paths? Ex: Instead of always taking the left path, a pr ogram uses the path
width to decide which path to take. If the left path is wider , take the right path. Else, take the left path.
Abranch is a gr oup of statements that e xecute based on a condition. The Expr essions chapter intr oduced

bool data type
People often ask binary questions such as yes/no or true/false questions. Ex: Do you like pineapple on pizza?
Ex: T rue or false: I like pineapple on pizza. The r esponse is a Boolean value, meaning the value is either true or
false. The bool data type, standing for Boolean, r epresents a binary value of either true or false. trueand
falseare keywor ds, and capitalization is r equir ed.

Python has thr ee logical oper ators: and,or, and not. The and oper ator takes two condition oper ands and
returns Trueif both conditions ar e true.100 4 • Decisions

•Describe ho w pr ecedence impacts or der of oper ations.

•Explain the purpose of using par entheses in e xpressions with multiple oper ators.
Precedence
When an e xpression has multiple oper ators, which oper ator is e valuated first? Pr ecedence rules pr ovide the
priority le vel of oper ators. Oper ators with the highest pr ecedence e xecute first. Ex: 1+2*3is7because
multiplication takes pr ecedence o ver addition. Ho wever,(1+2) *3is9because par entheses take
precedence o ver multiplication.

Associativity
What if oper ators beside each other have the same le vel of pr ecedence? Associativity determines the or der of
oper ations when pr ecedence is the same. Ex: 8/4*3is evaluated as (8/4) *3rather than 8/ (4*3)
because multiplication and division ar e left associative. Most oper ators ar e left associative and ar e evaluated
from left to right. Exponentiation is the main e xception (noted abo ve) and is right associative: that is, e valuated
from right to left. Ex: 2**3**4is evaluated as 2** (3**4).
When comparison oper ators ar e chained, the e xpression is converted into the equivalent combination of4.4 • Oper ator pr ecedence 105

•Avoid multiple spaces and an unequal amount of whitespace ar ound oper ators with two oper ands.
Avoid: x= y *44
Better: x = y * 44
•Avoid spaces immediately inside par entheses.
Avoid: x = (4* y )
Better: x = (4* y)
•Surr ound the follo wing oper ators with one space: assignment, augment assignment, comparison,
Boolean.

Learning objectives
By the end of this section you should be able to
•Identify the br anches taken in an if-elifand if-elif-elsestatement.
•Create a chained decision statement to e valuate multiple conditions.
elif
Sometimes, a complicated decision is based on mor e than a single condition. Ex: A tr avel planning site r eviews
the layo vers on an itiner ary. If a layo ver is gr eater than 24 hours, the site should suggest accommodations.
Else if the layo ver is less than one hour , the site should alert for a possible missed connection.4.5 • Chained decisions 107
Two separ ateifstatements do not guar antee that only one br anch is taken and might r esult in both br anches
being taken. Ex: The pr ogram belo w attempts to add a curve based on the input test scor e. If the input is 60,
both ifstatements ar e incorr ectly e xecuted, and the r esulting scor e is 75.
score = int(input())
ifscore < 70:
score += 10
# Wrong:
if70<= score < 85:
score += 5
Chaining decision statements with elifallows the pr ogrammer to check for multiple conditions. An elif(short
for else if ) statement checks a condition when the prior decision statement 's condition is false. An elif
statement is part of a chain and must follo w an if(orelif) statement.

Nested decision statements
Suppose a pr ogrammer is writing a pr ogram that r eads in a game ID and player count and prints whether the
user has the right number of players for the game.
The pr ogrammer may start with:
ifgame == 1andplayers < 2:
print("Not enough players" )
ifgame == 1andplayers > 4:
print("Too many players" )
ifgame == 1and(2<= players <= 4):
print("Ready to start" )
ifgame == 2andplayers < 3:
print("Not enough players" )
ifgame == 2andplayers > 6:
print("Too many players" )
ifgame == 2and(3<= players <= 6):
print("Ready to start" )

A conditional e xpression is e valuated b y first checking the condition. If condition is true,
expression_if_true is evaluated, and the r esult is the r esulting value of the conditional e xpression. Else,
expression_if_false is evaluated, and the r esult is the r esulting value of the conditional e xpression.
A variable can be assigned with a conditional e xpression. Ex: Finding the max of two numbers can be

5.6Chapter summary
Introduction
Aloop is a code block that runs a set of statements while a given condition is true. A loop is often used for
performing a r epeating task. Ex: The softwar e on a phone r epeatedly checks to see if the phone is idle. Once
the time set b y a user is r eached, the phone is locked. Loops can also be used for iter ating o ver lists like
student names in a r oster , and printing the names one at a time.
In this chapter , two types of loops, forloop and whileloop, ar e intr oduced. This chapter also intr oduces
breakand continue statements for contr olling a loop 's execution.
5.1 While loop
Learning objectives
By the end of this section you should be able to
•Explain the loop construct in Python.
•Use a whileloop to implement r epeating tasks.
While loop
Awhile loop is a code construct that runs a set of statements, kno wn as the loop body , while a given
condition, kno wn as the loop e xpression, is true. At each iter ation, once the loop statement is e xecuted, the
Loops5

loop e xpression is e valuated again.
•If true, the loop body will e xecute at least one mor e time (also called looping or iter ating one mor e time).
•If false, the loop 's execution will terminate and the ne xt statement after the loop body will e xecute.

While loop example
Fibonacci is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two pr eceding numbers. The
Fibonacci sequence starts with two ones: 1, 1, 2, 3, . . . . Consider the follo wing code that prints all Fibonacci
numbers less than 20, and answer the follo wing questions.
# Initializing the first two Fibonacci numbers
f =1
g =1
print(f, end = ' ')
# Running the loop while the last Fibonacci number is less than 20
whileg <20:
print(g, end = ' ')
# Calculating the next Fibonacci number and updating the last two sequence
numbers
temp = f
f = g

Counting with a while loop
Awhileloop can be used to count up or do wn. A counter variable can be used in the loop e xpression to
determine the number of iter ations e xecuted. Ex: A pr ogrammer may want to print all e ven numbers between
1 and 20. The task can be done b y using a counter initialized with 1. In each iter ation, the counter 's value is
increased b y one, and a condition can check whether the counter 's value is an e ven number or not. The
change in the counter 's value in each iter ation is called the step size . The step size can be any positive or
negative value. If the step size is a positive number , the counter counts in ascending or der, and if the step size
is a negative number , the counter counts in descending or der.
EXAMPLE 5.1
A program printing all odd numbers between 1 and 10
# Initialization
counter = 1
# While loop condition
whilecounter <= 10:
ifcounter % 2==1:
print(counter)
# Counting up and increasing counter's value by 1 in each iteration
counter += 1

For loop
In Python, a container can be a r ange of numbers, a string of char acters, or a list of values. T o access objects
within a container , an iter ative loop can be designed to r etrie ve objects one at a time. A for loop iterates o ver
all elements in a container . Ex: Iter ating o ver a class r oster and printing students' names.

Range()function in for loop
Aforloop can be used for iter ation and counting. The range()function is a common appr oach for
implementing counting in a forloop. A range() function gener ates a sequence of integers between the two
numbers given a step size. This integer sequence is inclusive of the start and e xclusive of the end of the
sequence. The range()function can take up to thr ee input values. Examples ar e provided in the table belo w.

Break
Abreak statement is used within a foror a whileloop to allo w the pr ogram e xecution to e xit the loop once a
given condition is trigger ed. A breakstatement can be used to impr ove runtime efficiency when further loop
execution is not r equir ed.
Ex: A loop that looks for the char acter "a"in a given string called user_string . The loop belo w is a r egular
forloop for going thr ough all the char acters of user_string . If the char acter is found, the br eak statement
takes e xecution out of the forloop. Since the task has been accomplished, the r est of the forloop e xecution
is bypassed.
user_string = "This is a string."

Abreakstatement is an essential part of a loop that does not have a termination condition. A loop without
a termination condition is kno wn as an infinite loop . Ex: An infinite loop that counts up starting fr om 1 and
prints the counter 's value while the counter 's value is less than 10. A breakcondition is trigger ed when the
counter 's value is equal to 10, and hence the pr ogram e xecution e xits.

5.5 Loop else
Learning objectives
By the end of this section you should be able to
•Use loop elsestatement to identify when the loop e xecution is interrupted using a breakstatement.
•Implement a loop elsestatement with a foror a whileloop.
Loop else
Aloop else statement runs after the loop 's execution is completed without being interrupted b y a br eak
statement. A loop elseis used to identify if the loop is terminated normally or the e xecution is interrupted b y
abreakstatement.
Ex: A forloop that iter ates o ver a list of numbers to find if the value 10is in the list. In each iter ation, if 10is
observed, the statement "Found 10!" is printed and the e xecution can terminate using a br eak statement. If
10is not in the list, the loop terminates when all integers in the list ar e evaluated, and hence the else
statement will run and print "10 is not in the list." Alternatively , a Boolean variable can be used to
track whether number 10is found after loop 's execution terminates.
EXAMPLE 5.4
Finding the number 10 in a list
In the code e xamples belo w, the code on the left prints "Found 10!" if the variable i's value is 10. If the
value 10is not in the list, the code prints "10 is not in the list." . The code on the right uses the

Introduction
Functions ar e the ne xt step to ward creating optimized code as a softwar e de veloper . If the same block of code
is reused r epeatedly , a function allo ws the pr ogrammer to write the block of code once, name the block, and
use the code as many times as needed b y calling the block b y name. Functions can r ead in values and r eturn
values to perform tasks, including comple x calculations.
Like br anching statements discussed in the Decisions chapter , functions allo w differ ent paths of e xecution
through a pr ogram, and this chapter discusses contr ol flo w and the scope of variables in mor e detail.
6.1 Defining functions
Learning objectives
By the end of this section you should be able to
•Identify function calls in a pr ogram.
•Define a par ameterless function that outputs strings.
•Describe benefits of using functions.
Functions6

Calling a function
Throughout the book, functions have been called to perform tasks. Ex: print()prints values, and sqrt()
calculates the squar e root. A function is a named, r eusable block of code that performs a task when called.

Defining a function
A function is defined using the defkeywor d. The first line contains deffollo wed b y the function name (in
snake case), par entheses (with any par ameters—discussed later), and a colon. The indented body begins with
a documentation string describing the function 's task and contains the function statements. A function must
be defined befor e the function is called.

Benefits of functions
A function pr omotes modularity b y putting code statements r elated to a single task in a separ ate gr oup. The
body of a function can be e xecuted r epeatedly with multiple function calls, so a function pr omotes r eusability .
Modular , reusable code is easier to modify and is shar eable among pr ogrammers to avoid r einventing the

Contr ol flo w and functions
Contr ol flo wis the sequence of pr ogram e xecution. A pr ogram's contr ol flo w begins at the main pr ogram but
rarely follo ws a strict sequence. Ex: Contr ol flo w skips o ver lines when a conditional statement isn 't executed.
When e xecution r eaches a function call, contr ol flo w mo ves to wher e the function is defined and e xecutes the
function statements. Then, contr ol flo w mo ves back to wher e the function was called and continues the

BENEFI TS OF LIMI TING SCOPE
A programmer might ask, " Why not just make all variables global variables to avoid access err ors?" Making
every variable global can make a pr ogram messy . Ex: A pr ogrammer debugging a lar ge pr ogram disco vers
a variable has the wr ong value. If the whole pr ogram can modify the variable, then the bug could be
anywher e in the lar ge pr ogram. Limiting a variable 's scope to only what 's necessary and r estricting global
variable use make a pr ogram easier to debug, maintain, and update.

What if a pr ogrammer wants to write a function that prints the contents of a list? Good pr actice is to pass
values dir ectly to a function r ather than r elying on global variables. A function argument is a value passed as

uses a pass-b y-object-r efer ence system. If an ar gument is changed in a function, the changes ar e kept or lost
depending on the object 's mutability . Amutable object can be modified after cr eation. A function 's changes to
the object then appear outside the function. An immutable object cannot be modified after cr eation. So a
function must make a local cop y to modify , and the local cop y's changes don 't appear outside the function.
Programmers should be cautious of modifying function ar guments as these side effects can make pr ograms
difficult to debug and maintain.

•Function calls can use ke ywor d arguments to map values using par ameter names in any or der.
•Functions can define default par ameter values to allo w for optional ar guments in function calls.
•Python uses a pass-b y-object-r eference system to assign par ameters with the object values r eferenced b y

7.6Chapter summary
Introduction
As pr ograms get longer and mor e comple x, or ganizing the code into modules is helpful. This chapter sho ws
how to define, import, and find ne w modules. Python 'sstandar d libr ary(https://openstax.or g/r/100p ythlibr ary)
provides o ver 200 built-in modules (https://openstax.or g/r/100200modules) . Hundr eds of thousands of other
modules (https://openstax.or g/r/100p ypi)are available online.
Amodule is a.pyfile containing function definitions and other statements. The module 's name is the file 's
name without the .pyextension at the end. Ex: The follo wing code, written in a file named greetings.p y,
defines a module named greetings .
"""Functions that print standard greetings."""
defhello():
print("Hello!" )
defbye():
print("Goodbye!" )
Modules7

Technically , every pr ogram in this book is a module. But not e very module is designed to run like a pr ogram.
Running greetings.p yas a pr ogram would accomplish very little. T wo functions would be defined, but the
functions would ne ver be called. These functions ar e intended to be called in other modules.
7.1 Module basics
Learning objectives
By the end of this section you should be able to
•Write a module that consists only of function definitions.
•Import the module and use the functions in a pr ogram.
Defining a module
Modules ar e defined b y putting code in a .pyfile. The areamodule belo w is in a file named ar ea.p y. This
module pr ovides functions for calculating ar ea.

Care should be taken to avoid name collisions. Selecting specific functions fr om a module to import r educes

Example colors module
A module for working with HTML color codes would be helpful to gr aphic designers and web de velopers. The
follo wing Python code is in a file named colors.p y.
•Line 1 is the docstring for the module.
•Lines 3–16 assign variables for fr equently used colors.
•Lines 18–24 define a function to be used within the module.
•Lines 26–45 define functions to be used in other modules.
Note: The tohex()and torgb()functions use Python featur es (string formatting and slicing) described later
in the book. For no w, the documentation and comments ar e mor e important than the implementation details.

Introduction
Astring is a sequence of char acters. Python pr ovides useful methods for pr ocessing string values. In this
chapter , string methods will be demonstr ated including comparing string values, string slicing, sear ching,
testing, formatting, and modifying.
8.1 String oper ations
Learning objectives
By the end of this section you should be able to
•Compar e strings using logical and membership oper ators.
•Use lower()and upper()string methods to convert string values to lo wercase and upper case
char acters.
String comparison
String values can be compar ed using logical oper ators ( <,<=,>,>=,==,!=) and membership oper ators ( inand
notin). When comparing two string values, the matching char acters in two string values ar e compar ed
sequentially until a decision is r eached. For comparing two char acters, ASCII values ar e used to apply logical
oper ators.
Strings8

Oper ator Description Example Output Explanation
>or>=Checks whether the
first string value is
greater than (or gr eater
than or equal to) the
second string value."c">
"d"FalseWhen comparing "c"oper and to "d"
oper and, the ASCII value for "c"is smaller
than the ASCII value for "d". Ther efore,"c"
<"d". The e xpression "c">"d"
evaluates to False.
<or<=Checks whether the
first string value is less
than (or less than or
equal to) the second
string value."ab"<
"ac"TrueWhen comparing "ab"oper and to "ac"
oper and, the first char acters ar e the same,
but the second char acter of "ab"is less
than the second char acter in "ac"and as
such "ab"<"ac".
==Checks whether two
string values ar e equal."aa"==
"aa"TrueSince all char acters in the first oper and and
the second oper and ar e the same, the two
string values ar e equal.
!=Checks whether two
string values ar e not
equal."a"!=
"b"TrueThe two oper ands contain differ ent string
values ( "a"vs."b"), and the r esult of
checking whether the two ar e not the same
evaluates to T rue.
inChecks whether the
second oper and
contains the first
oper and."a"in
"bc"FalseSince string "bc"does not contain string
"a", the output of "a"in"bc"evaluates
to False.
notinChecks whether the
second oper and does
not contain the first
oper and."a"not
in"bc"TrueSince string "bc"does not contain string
"a", the output of "a"notin"bc"
evaluates to T rue.

lower() and upper()
Python has many useful methods for modifying strings, two of which ar elower()and upper()methods. The
lower() method r eturns the converted alphabetical char acters to lo wercase, and the upper() method r eturns
the converted alphabetical char acters to upper case. Both the lower()and upper()methods do notmodify
the string.
EXAMPLE 8.1
Conv erting char acters in a string
In the e xample belo w, the lower()and upper()string methods ar e called on the string variable xto
convert all char acters to lo wercase and upper case, r espectively .
x ="Apples"
# The lower() method converts a string to all lowercase characters
print(x.lower())
# The upper() method converts a string to all uppercase characters

8.2 String slicing
Learning objectives
By the end of this section you should be able to
•Use string inde xing to access char acters in the string.
•Use string slicing to get a substring fr om a string.
•Identify immutability char acteristics of strings.
String inde xing
A string is a type of sequence. A string is made up of a sequence of char acters inde xed fr om left to right,
starting at 0. For a string variable s, the left-most char acter is inde xed 0 and the right-most char acter is
inde xedlen(s) -1. Ex: The length of the string "Cloud"is 5, so the last inde x is 4.
Negative inde xing can also be used to r efer to char acters fr om right to left starting at -1. For a string variable
s, the left-most char acter is inde xed-len(s)and the right-most char acter is inde xed -1. Ex: The length of the
string "flower" is 6, so the inde x of the first char acter with negative inde xing is -6.200 8 • Strings

String slicing is used when a pr ogrammer must get access to a sequence of char acters. Her e, a string slicing
oper ator can be used. When [a:b]is used with the name of a string variable, a sequence of char acters
starting fr om inde xa(inclusive) up to inde xb(exclusive) is r eturned. Both aand bare optional. If aorbare not
provided, the default values ar e 0 and len(string) , respectively .

String objects ar eimmutable meaning that string objects cannot be modified or changed once cr eated. Once
a string object is cr eated, the string' s contents cannot be alter ed b y dir ectly modifying individual char acters or

8.4 String formatting
Learning objectives
By the end of this section you should be able to
•Format a string template using input ar guments.
•Use format()to gener ate numerical formats based on a given template.
String format specification
Python pr ovides string substitutions syntax for formatting strings with input ar guments. Formatting string
includes specifying string pattern rules and modifying the string accor ding to the formatting specification.
Examples of formatting strings include using patterns for building differ ent string values and specifying
modification rules for the string' s length and alignment.
String formatting with r eplacement fields
Replacement fields are used to define a pattern for cr eating multiple string values that comply with a given8.4 • String formatting 209
format. The e xample belo w sho ws two string values that use the same template for making r equests to
differ ent individuals for taking differ ent courses.
EXAMPLE 8.5
String v alues fr om the same template
Dear John, I'd like to take a programming course with Prof. Potter.
Dear Kishwar, I'd like to take a math course with Prof. Robinson.
In the e xample abo ve, r eplacement fields ar e 1) the name of the individual the r equest is being made to, 2)
title of the course, and 3) the name of the instructor . To create a template, r eplacement fields can be added
with {}to sho w a placeholder for user input. The format() method is used to pass inputs for r eplacement
fields in a string template.
EXAMPLE 8.6
String template formatting for course enr ollment r equests
A string template with r eplacement fields is defined belo w to cr eate string values with differ ent input
arguments. The format()method is used to pass inputs to the template in the same or der.

print(s)
print(s. format("John","programming" ,"Potter" ))

Named r eplacement fields
Replacement fields can be tagged with a label, called named r eplacement fields , for ease of access and code
readability . The e xample belo w illustr ates ho w named r eplacement fields can be used in string templates.
EXAMPLE 8.7
Season weather template using named r eplacement fields
A named r eplacement ar gument is a convenient way of assigning name tags to r eplacement fields and
passing values associated with r eplacement fields using corr esponding names (instead of passing values in
order).
s ="Weather in {season} is {temperature}."
print(s)
print(s. format(season = "summer" , temperature = "hot"))
print(s. format(season = "winter" , temperature = "cold"))
The abo ve code 's output is:
Weather in{season} is{temperature}.
Weather insummerishot.
Weather inwinteriscold.
MULTIPLE USE OF A N AMED ARGUMEN T
Since named r eplacement fields ar e referr ed to using a name ke y, a named r eplacement field can appear
and be used mor e than once in the template. Also, positional or dering is not necessary when named
replacement fields ar e used.8.4 • String formatting 211
s ="Weather in {season} is {temperature}; very very {temperature}."

print(s. format(season = "summer" , temperature = "hot"))

Number ed replacement fields
Python 's string format()method can use positional or dering to match the number ed ar guments. The
replacement fields that use the positional or dering of ar guments ar e called number ed replacement fields .
The inde xing of the ar guments starts fr om 0. Ex: print("{1}{0}" .format("Home","Welcome" ))outputs
the string value "Welcome Home" as the first ar gument. "Home"is at inde x 0, and the second ar gument,
"Welcome" , is at inde x 1. Replacing these ar guments in the or der of "{1}{0}" creates the string "Welcome212 8 • Strings
Access for fr ee at openstax.or g
Home".
Number ed replacement fields can use ar gument 's values for multiple r eplacement fields b y using the same
argument inde x. The e xample belo w illustr ates ho w an ar gument is used for mor e than one number ed
replacement field.
EXAMPLE 8.8
Number ed replacement field t o build a phr ase
Number ed replacement fields ar e used in this e xample to build phr ases like "very very cold" or"very
hot".
template1 = "{0} {0} {1}"
template2 = "{0} {1}"
print(template1. format("very","cold"))
print(template2. format("very","hot"))
The abo ve code 's output is:
very very cold
very hot
String length and alignment formatting
Formatting the string length may be needed for standar dizing the output style when multiple string values of
the same conte xt ar e being cr eated and printed. The e xample belo w sho ws a use case of string formatting in
printing a table with minimum-length columns and specific alignment.
EXAMPLE 8.9
A formatted table of a class r oster
A formatted table of a class r oster
Student Name Major Grade
----------------------------------------------
Manoj Sara Computer Science A-
Gabriel Wang Electrical Engineering A
Alex Narayanan Social Sciences A+
In the e xample abo ve, the table is formatted into thr ee columns. The first column takes up 15 char acters and is
left-aligned. The second column uses 25 char acters and is center-aligned, and the last column uses two
char acters and is right aligned. Alignment and length format specifications contr ols ar e used to cr eate the8.4 • String formatting 213
formatted table.
The field width in string format specification is used to specify the minimum length of the given string. If the
string is shorter than the given minimum length, the string will be padded b y space char acters. A field width
is included in the format specification field using an integer after a colon. Ex: {name:15}specifies that the
minimum length of the string values that ar e passed to the namefield is 15.
Since the field width can be used to specify the minimum length of a string, the string can be padded with
space char acters fr om right, left, or both to be left-aligned, right-aligned, and center ed, r espectively . The
string alignment type is specified using <,>, or^char acters after the colon when field length is specified. Ex:
{name:^20}specifies a named r eplacement field with the minimum length of 20 char acters that is center-
aligned.

Formatting numbers
The format()method can be used to format numerical values. Numerical values can be padded to have a
given minimum length, pr ecision, and sign char acter . The syntax for modifying numeric values follo ws the
{[index]:[width][.precision][ type]}structur e. In the given syntax,
•The indexfield r efers to the inde x of the ar gument.
•The widthfield r efers to the minimum length of the string.
•The precision field r efers to the floating-point pr ecision of the given number .
•The typefield sho ws the type of the input that is passed to the format()method. Floating-point and
decimal inputs ar e identified b y"f"and "d", respectively . String values ar e also identified b y"s".
The table belo w summarizes formatting options for modifying numeric values.

By the end of this section you should be able to
•Use the split()method to split a string into substrings.
•Combine objects in a list into a string using join()method.
split()
A string in Python can be br oken into substrings given a delimiter . A delimiter is also r eferr ed to as a
separ ator. The split() method, when applied to a string, splits the string into substrings b y using the given
argument as a delimiter . Ex: "1-2".split('-')returns a list of substrings ["1","2"]. When no ar guments
are given to the split()method, blank space char acters ar e used as delimiters. Ex: "1\t2\n3 4" .split()
returns ["1","2","3","4"].

Introduction
Programmers often work on collections of data. Lists ar e a useful way of collecting data elements. Python lists
are extremely fle xible, and, unlike strings, a list 's contents can be changed.
The Objects chapter intr oduced lists. This chapter e xplor es oper ations that can be performed on lists.

Learning objectives
By the end of this section you should be able to
•Modify a list using append() ,remove() , and pop()list oper ations.
•Sear ch a list using a forloop.
Using list oper ations to modify a list
Anappend() oper ation is used to add an element to the end of a list. In pr ogramming, append means add to
the end. A remove() oper ation r emo ves the specified element fr om a list. A pop()oper ation r emo ves the last
item of a list.

Learning objectives
By the end of this section you should be able to
•Understand the concept of sorting.
•Use built-in sort()and reverse() methods.
Sorting
Ordering elements in a sequence is often useful. Sorting is the task of arr anging elements in a sequence in
ascending or descending or der.
Sorting can work on numerical or non-numerical data. When or dering te xt, dictionary or der is used. Ex: "bat "
comes befor e "cat" because "b " comes befor e "c".

Using sort()and reverse()
Python pr ovides methods for arr anging elements in a list.
•The sort()method arr anges the elements of a list in ascending or der. For strings, ASCII values ar e used
and upper case char acters come befor e lowercase char acters, leading to une xpected r esults. Ex: "A"is
ordered befor e"a"in ascending or der but so is "G"; thus, "Gail"comes befor e"apple".
•The reverse() method r everses the elements in a list.

Using built-in oper ations
The max()function called on a list r eturns the lar gest element in the list. The min()function called on a list
returns the smallest element in the list. The max()and min()functions work for lists as long as elements
within the list ar e compar able.
The sum()function called on a list of numbers r eturns the sum of all elements in the list.

List-of-lists
Lists can be made of any type of element. A list element can also be a list. Ex: [2, [3,5],17]is a valid list
with the list [3,5]being the element at inde x 1.
When a list is an element inside a lar ger list, it is called a nested list . Nested lists ar e useful for e xpressing
multidimensional data. When each of the elements of a lar ger list is a smaller list, the lar ger list is called a list-
of-lists .
Ex: A table can be stor ed as a two-dimensional list-of-lists, wher e each r ow of data is a list in the list-of-lists.

Alist compr ehension is a Python statement to compactly cr eate a ne w list using a pattern.
The gener al form of a list compr ehension statement is sho wn belo w.
list_name = [expression forloop_variable initerable]
list_name refers to the name of a ne w list, which can be anything, and the foris the forloop ke ywor d. An
expression defines what will become part of the ne w list. loop_variable is an iter ator, and iterable is an
object that can be iter ated, such as a list or string.

Dictionary mutability
In Python, a dictionary is a mutable data type, which means that a dictionary 's content can be modified after
creation. Dictionary items can be added, updated, or deleted fr om a dictionary after a dictionary object is
created.
To add an item to a dictionary , either the squar e bracket notation or update() function can be used.
•Squar e bracket notation: When using squar e brackets to cr eate a ne w ke y object and assign a value to the
key, the ne w ke y-value pair will be added to the dictionary .
my_dict = { "apple":2,"banana" :3,"orange" :4}
my_dict[ "pineapple" ] =1
print(my_dict) # Prints: {"apple": 2, "banana": 3, "orange": 4, "pineapple": 1}
•update() method: the update() method can be called with additional ke y-value pairs to update the
dictionary content.
my_dict = { "apple":2,"banana" :3,"orange" :4}
my_dict.update({ "pineapple" :1,"cherry" :0})
print(my_dict) # Prints: {"apple": 2, "banana": 3, "orange": 4, "pineapple": 1,
"cherry": 0}
To modify a dictionary item, the two appr oaches abo ve can be used on an e xisting dictionary ke y along with
the updated value. Ex:
•Squar e bracket notation:
my_dict = { "apple":2,"banana" :3,"orange" :4}
my_dict[ "apple"] =1
print(my_dict) # Prints: {"apple": 1, "banana": 3, "orange": 4}
•update() method:
my_dict = { "apple":2,"banana" :3,"orange" :4}
my_dict.update({ "apple":1})
print(my_dict) # Prints: {"apple": 1, "banana": 3, "orange": 4}
Items can be deleted fr om a dictionary using the delkeywor d or the pop()method.
•delkeywor d:
my_dict = { "apple":2,"banana" :3,"orange" :4}
delmy_dict[ "orange" ]
print(my_dict) # Prints: {"apple": 2, "banana": 3}

organizational chart with ke ys being differ ent departments and values being dictionaries of emplo yees in a
given department. For storing emplo yee information in a department, a dictionary can be used with ke ys
being emplo yee IDs and values being emplo yee names. The tables belo w outline the structur e of such nested

Introduction
A programmer can model r eal-world entities as objects for better pr ogram design and or ganization. A class
defines a type of object with attributes and methods. Many instances of a class type can be cr eated to
represent multiple objects in a pr ogram.
Classes pr omote r eusability . Classes add benefits like data abstr action and encapsulation, which or ganize code
for better usability and e xtensibility .

Grouping into objects
Object-oriented pr ogramming (OOP) is a style of pr ogramming that gr oups r elated fields, or data members,
Classes11

and pr ocedur es into objects. Real-world entities ar e modeled as individual objects that inter act with each
other . Ex: A social media account can follo w other accounts, and accounts can send messages to each other . An
account can be modeled as an object in a pr ogram.

Encapsulation
Encapsulation is a ke y concept in OOP that involves wr apping data and pr ocedur es that oper ate on that data
into a single unit. Access to the unit 's data is r estricted to pr event other units fr om dir ectly modifying the data.

Learning objectives
By the end of this section you should be able to

•Use a class definition to cr eate class instances to r epresent objects.
Classes and instances
In the pr evious section, a r eal-world entity , like a person 's social media pr ofile, was modeled as a single object.
How could a pr ogrammer de velop a softwar e system that manages millions of pr ofiles? A blueprint that
defines the fields and pr ocedur es of a pr ofile would be crucial.
In a Python pr ogram, a class defines a type of object with attributes (fields) and methods (pr ocedur es). A class
is a blueprint for cr eating objects. Individual objects cr eated of the class type ar e called instances .11.2 • Classes and instances 267

•Classes define a type of object with attributes and methods.
•Instances of a class type r epresent objects and ar e created using __init__() .
•Attributes may belong to the instance (unique for each instance) or the class (shar ed b y all instances).
•Instance methods have the first par ameter selfto access the specific instance.
•Python uses magic methods to perform " under-the-hood" actions for users. Magic methods always start
and end with double underscor es.
•Python allo ws o verloading of e xisting oper ators for user-defined classes.
•Classes can be imported fr om modules b y name or can be r enamed using aliases.

Introduction
Recursion is a po werful pr ogramming technique to write solutions compactly . Recursion simplifies pr ograms
by calling smaller versions of a given pr oblem that ar e used to gener ate the solution to the o verall pr oblem.
In advanced pr ogramming, some pr ograms ar e difficult to write without the use of r ecursion. So r ecursion is
also a style of pr ogramming that enables us to simplify pr ograms.
Recursion enables a piece of code, a function, to call the same piece of code, the same function, with differ ent
parameters.

By the end of this section you should be able to
•Identify a r ecursive case and a base case in a r ecursive algorithm.
•Demonstr ate ho w to compute a r ecursive solution for the factorial function.
Calculating a factorial
The factorial of a positive integer is defined as the pr oduct of the integer and the positive integers less than
the integer .
Ex:5! =5*4*3*2*1
Written as a gener al equation for a positive integer n:n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * . . . * 1
The abo ve formula for the factorial of nresults in a r ecursive formula: n! = n * (n - 1)!
Thus, the factorial of ndepends upon the value of the factorial at n -1. The factorial of ncan be found b y
repeating the factorial of n -1until (n -1)! =1!(we kno w that 1! =1). This r esult can be used to build
the o verall solution as seen in the animation belo w.

4.Listing the Fibonacci sequence of numbers.
Defining a r ecursive function
Recursive algorithms ar e written in Python as functions. In a r ecursive function differ ent actions ar e performed
accor ding to the input par ameter value. A critical part of a r ecursive function is that the function must call
itself .
A value for which the r ecursion applies is called the recursive case . In the r ecursive case, the function calls
itself with a smaller portion of the input par ameter . Ex: In the r ecursive function factorial() , the initial
parameter is an integer n. In the function 's recursive case, the ar gument passed to factorial() isn -1,
which is smaller than n.
A value of nfor which the solution is kno wn is called the base case . The base case stops the r ecursion. A
recursive algorithm must include a base case; otherwise, the algorithm may r esult in an infinite computation.
To calculate a factorial, a r ecursive function, factorial() is defined with an integer input par ameter ,n. When
n >1, the r ecursive case applies. The factorial() calls itself with a smaller ar gument, n -1. When n ==
1, the solution is kno wn because 1!is1; ther efore,n ==1is a base case.
Note: 0!is defined to be 1; ther efore,n ==0is a second base case for factorial() . When n <1, an err or
is returned.

•Define a r ecursive function to gener ate Fibonacci numbers.
Fibonacci sequence using r ecursion
The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number in the sequence is the sum of the pr evious two
numbers in the sequence. The first two numbers ar e 0 and 1. Thus, starting fr om 0 and 1, the thir d number is
0 + 1 = 1, and the ne xt number is 1 + 1 = 2. The sequence of numbers is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ... .
Recursion can be used to calculate the nth Fibonacci number . The base cases ar e 0 and 1. Ther eafter , the nth
number is given b y adding the (n - 1)th and (n - 2)th number . Thus, fib(n) = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2),
which is a r ecursive definition ending with base cases f(0) =0, and f(1) =1.
For a r ecursion that calls multiple functions in the r ecursive case, tr acing ho w the r ecursion pr oceeds is useful.
A structur e used to tr ace the calls made b y a r ecursive function is called a recursion tr ee. The animation belo w

Binary sear ch
Sear ching a sorted list usually involves looking at each item. If the item being sear ched is not found, then the
sear ch can take a long time.
A binary sear ch is a r ecursive algorithm used to efficiently sear ch sorted lists. In each r ecursive step, about half
the items ar e discar ded as not being potential matches, so the sear ch pr oceeds much faster .
A binary sear ch begins b y checking the middle element of the list. If the sear ch ke y is found, the algorithm
returns the matching location (base case). Otherwise, the sear ch is r epeated on appr oximately half the list. If
the ke y is gr eater than the middle element, then the ke y must be on the right half , and vice versa. The pr ocess
continues b y checking the middle element of the r emaining half of the list.

Introduction
Real-world entities ar e often described in r elation to other entities. Ex: A finch is a type of bir d. Similarly ,
classes, which r epresent types of r eal-world entities, can be r elated to each other .
Inheritance describes the r elationship in which one class is a type of another class. Classes within inheritance
relationships can inherit attributes and methods fr om other classes without needing to r edefine e verything.
Thus, inheritance in object-oriented pr ogramming r educes r edundancy and pr omotes modularity .

super class' s attributes and methods, and e xtends the super class' s functionality .
In Python, a subclass is cr eated b y including the super class name in par entheses at the top of the subclass' s

Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the concept of having many forms. In pr ogramming, a single name can be used for multiple
functionalities. Within inheritance, polymorphism is the basis of method o verriding, as multiple methods have
the same name.
EXAMPLE 13.1
Polymorphism and inheritance
The name display() maps to multiple methods. The class type of the calling object determines which
display() method is e xecuted.312 13 • Inheritance
Access for fr ee at openstax.or g
classPlant:
defdisplay(self):
print("I'm a plant" )

defdisplay(self):
print("I'm a lavender" )
mint_1 = Mint()
mint_1.display()
lavender_1 = Lavender()
lavender_1.display()
The code 's output is:
I'm a mint
I'm a lavender
Polymorphism can also be used with methods of unr elated classes. The class type of the calling object
determines the method e xecuted.
EXAMPLE 13.2
Polymorphism and methods
Taxand ContractTax are unr elated classes that each define calc_tax() .calc_tax() isn't overridden as
ContractTax isn't inherited fr omTax.
classTax:

print("Calculating tax" )
total = 0.10* self.value # To replace with calculation

returntotal
my_tax = ContractTax(value= 1000)# Replace 1000 with any value
result = my_tax.calc_tax()
print(f"Total tax: $ {result} ")
The code 's output is:
Calculating contracts tax

The diamond pr oblem and mixin classes
Multiple inheritance should be implemented with car e. The diamond pr oblem occurs when a class inherits
from multiple classes that shar e a common super class. Ex: Dessertand BakedGood both inherit fr omFood,
and ApplePie inherits fr omDessertand BakedGood .
Figur e13.2 The diamond pr oblem. If both Dessertand BakedGood override a Foodmethod, the o verridden Foodmethod that
ApplePie inherits is ambiguous. Thus, diamond shaped inheritance should be avoided.
Mixin classes pr omote modularity and can r emo ve the diamond pr oblem. A mixin class:
•Has no super class
•Has attributes and methods to be added to a subclass
•Isn't instantiated (Ex: Given MyMixinclass, my_inst = MyMixin() should ne ver be used.)
Mixin classes are used in multiple inheritance to add functionality to a subclass without adding inheritance
concerns.

14.2 Writing t o files
Learning objectives
By the end of this section you should be able to
•Understand ho w to open a file for writing.
•Explain differ ent modes for opening a file in Python.
•Demonstr ate the use of the write()function to write to a file.
•Understand the importance of closing a file.
Opening a file for writing
A file may be opened for r eading, allo wing no changes, or for writing, allo wing changes to occur in the file. The
mode defines whether a file is opened for r eading only or for writing. The default mode of the open()
function is r eading only . A second mode par ameter defines the mode.
Ex:open("output.txt" ,'w')opens the output.txt file in writing mode. The follo wing table lists common
modes.14.2 • W riting to files 331
Parameter Mode name and description Example
'r'Read mode:
Open the specified file for r eading.
If the file does not e xist, an err or occurs.
When no mode par ameter is used, the default is to open a file
in read mode.fileobj =
open("input.txt" )
same as:
fileobj =
open("input.txt" ,
'r')
'w'Write mode:
Open the specified file for writing.
If the file does not e xist, then the file is cr eated.
If the file alr eady e xists, the contents of the file ar e overwritten.fileobj =
open("output.txt" ,
'w')
'a'Append mode:
Open the specified file for appending, which means adding
information to the end of the e xisting file.
If the file does not e xist, then the file is cr eated.fileobj =
open("log.txt" ,'a')
Table 14.1 Modes for the open()function.
CONCEPT S IN PRA CTICE
File modes
Assume that a file named logfile.txt exists.
1.To read logfile.txt , which of the follo wing lines of code works best?
a.logfile = open("logfile.txt" )
b.logfile = open("logfile.txt" ,'w')
c.logfile = open("logfile.txt" ,'a')
2.Additions ar e to be made to logfile.txt . Which of the follo wing lines of code works best?
a.infile = open("logfile.txt" )
b.infile = open("logfile.txt" ,'w')
c.infile = open("logfile.txt" ,'a')
3.A ne w file called newlog.txt must be cr eated. Which of the follo wing lines of code works best?
a.logfile = open("newlog.txt" )
b.logfile = open("newlog.txt" ,'w')
c.logfile = open("newlog.txt" ,'a')
Using write()and close()
The write()function is used to write to an alr eady opened file. The write()function will only accept a string
parameter . Other variable types must be cast to string befor e writing using write().
The write()function does not automatically add a ne wline char acter as the print()function does. A
newline must be added e xplicitly b y adding a ne wline ('\n')char acter .332 14 • Files
Access for fr ee at openstax.or g
The write()function writes automatically to a tempor ary stor e called the file buffer . To ensur e that the
information is written to a file, the close()function must be used. The close()function finalizes changes
and closes the file.
EXAMPLE 14.2
Writing and appending t o a file
"""Operations for writing and appending to files."""
# Create a new file
opfile = open("output.txt" ,'w')
# Writing to the file
opfile.write( "Writing to a new file." )
# To add another line the newline character must be used
opfile.write( "\nSecond line." )
# Ensure changes are saved by closing the file
opfile.close()
# Read and display the contents of the file
infile = open("output.txt" )
print("\nRead the original file:\n" )
print(infile.read())
infile.close()
# Reopen the file in append mode to add to the file
opfile = open("output.txt" ,'a')
# Note the use of newline characters
opfile.write( "\nAdding to the file." )
opfile.write( "\nAdding another line." )
# Ensure changes are saved by closing the file
opfile.close()
# Read and display the contents of the modified file
infile = open("output.txt" )

14.3 Files in diff erent locations and working with CSV files
Learning objectives
By the end of this section you should be able to
•Demonstr ate ho w to access files within a file system.
•Demonstr ate ho w to pr ocess a CSV file.
Opening a file at any location
When only the filename is used as the ar gument to the open()function, the file must be in the same folder as
the Python file that is e xecuting. Ex: For fileobj = open("file1.txt" )infiles.p yto execute successfully ,
thefile1.txt file should be in the same folder as files.p y.
Often a pr ogrammer needs to open files fr om folders other than the one in which the Python file e xists. A path
uniquely identifies a folder location on a computer . The path can be used along with the filename to open a file
in any folder location. Ex: T o open a file named logfile.log located in /users/turtle/desktop the follo wing
can be used:
fileobj = open("/users/turtle/desktop/logfile.log" )14.3 • Files in differ ent locations and working with CSV files 335

or
fileobj =

Table 14.2 Opening files on differ ent paths. In each of the follo wing cases, a file called output.txt is located in a differ ent folder
than the Python folder . Windo ws uses backslash \ char acters instead of forwar d slash / char acters for the path. If the backslash is
included dir ectly in open(), then an additional backslash is needed for Python to understand the location corr ectly .
CONCEPT S IN PRA CTICE
Opening files at diff erent locations
For each question, assume that the Python file e xecuting the open()function is not in the same folder as
theout.txt file.
Each question indicates the location of out.txt , the type of computer , and the desir ed mode for opening the
file. Choose which option is best for opening out.txt .
1./users/turtle/files on a Mac for r eading
a.fileobj = open("out.txt" )
b.fileobj = open("/users/turtle/files/out.txt" )
c.fileobj = open("/users/turtle/files/out.txt" ,'w')
2.c:\documents\ on a Windo ws computer for r eading
a.fileobj = open("out.txt" )
b.fileobj = open("c:/documents/out.txt" ,'a')
c.fileobj = open("c:/documents/out.txt" )
3./users/turtle/logs on a Linux computer for writing
a.fileobj = open("out.txt" )
b.fileobj = open("/users/turtle/logs/out.txt" )
c.fileobj = open("/users/turtle/logs/out.txt" ,'w')
4.c:\proj\assets on a Windo ws computer in append mode

such as te xt files ( .txt), Python code files ( .py), and other code files ( .c,.java ).
Comma separ ated value (CSV ,.csv) files ar e often used for storing tabular data. These files stor e cells of
information as Unicode separ ated b y commas. CSV files can be r ead using methods learned thus far , as seen in
the e xample belo w.
Figur e14.2 CSV files. A CSV file is simply a te xt file with r ows separ ated b y newline \nchar acters and cells separ ated b y commas.

Programs can be designed to handle e xceptions, r ather than terminate. A trystatement runs code that might
raise an e xception. An exceptclause runs code in r esponse to the e xception.
EXAMPLE 14.5
Try to open a file
The follo wing pr ogram, named try_open.p y, asks the user for a filename and counts the number of lines in
the file.

Type analyz er
Analysis pr ograms often need to find numbers in lar ge bodies of te xt. Ho w can a pr ogram tell if a string like
"123.45" represents a number? One appr oach is to use e xceptions:
1.Try converting the string to an integer . If no ValueError is raised, then the string r epresents an
integer .
2.Otherwise, try converting the string to a float. If no ValueError is raised, then the string r epresents a
float.
3.Otherwise, the string does not r epresent a number .
Implement the get_type() function using this appr oach. The pr ovided main block calls get_type() for
each wor d in a file. get_type() should r eturn either "int","float", or"str", based on the wor d. The
output for the pr ovided data.txt is:

sear ch term. A ke y matches if the sear ch term is a substring of the ke y, ignoring case. Ex: The ke y
"banana" matches the sear ch term "NANA".
If no matching ke ys ar e found, lookup() should r aise a KeyError with the message "search term not
found". If multiple matches ar e found, lookup() should r aise a KeyError with the message "multiple
keys found" . Otherwise, lookup() should r eturn both the ke y and the value for the matching item in the
dictionary .346 14 • Files

Data science life cycle
Data science is a multidisciplinary field that combines collecting, pr ocessing, and analyzing lar ge volumes of
Data Science15

data to e xtract insights and drive informed decision-making. The data science life cycle is the fr ame work
follo wed b y data scientists to complete a data science pr oject. The data science life cycle is an iter ative pr ocess
that starts with data acquisition, follo wed b y data e xplor ation. The data acquisition stage may involve
obtaining data fr om a sour ce or collecting data thr ough surve ys and other means of data collection that ar e
domain-specific. During the data e xplor ation stage, data scientists will ensur e that the data ar e in the right
format for the data analysis stage thr ough data cleanup and the y may also visualize the data for further
inspection. Once the data ar e cleaned, data scientists can perform data analysis, which is shar ed with
stakeholders using r eports and pr esentations. The data analysis stage involves using data to gener ate
insights or make a pr edictive model. Data science is incr easingly being adopted in many differ ent fields, such
as healthcar e, economics, education, and social sciences, to name a fe w. The animation belo w demonstr ates

NumPy libr ary
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a Python libr ary that pr ovides support for efficient numerical oper ations on
large, multi-dimensional arr ays and serves as a fundamental building block for data analysis in Python. The
conventional alias for importing NumPy is np. In other wor ds, NumPy is imported as importnumpyasnp.
NumPy implements the ndarr ayobject, which allo ws the cr eation of a multi-dimensional arr ay of
homogeneous data types (columns with the same data type) and efficient data pr ocessing. An ndarrayobject
can have any number of dimensions and can stor e elements of various numeric data types. T o create a NumPy
ndarrayobject, one of the follo wing options can be used:
•Creating an ndarrayby converting a Python list or tuple using the np.array() function.
•Using built-in functions like np.zeros() and np.ones() for cr eating an arr ay of all 0' s or all 1' s,
respectively .
•Gener ating an arr ay with r andom numbers using np.random.rand(n, m) , wher enand mare the
number of r ows and columns, r espectively .
•Loading data fr om a file. Ex: np.genfromtxt( 'data.csv' , delimiter= ',').

Pandas libr ary
Pandas is an open-sour ce Python libr ary used for data cleaning, pr ocessing, and analysis. Pandas pr ovides
data structur es and data analysis tools to analyze structur ed data efficiently . The name "Pandas" is derived
from the term " panel data," which r efers to multidimensional structur ed datasets. Ke y featur es of Pandas
include:354 15 • Data Science
Access for fr ee at openstax.or g
•Data structur e: Pandas implements two main data structur es:
◦Series: A Series is a one-dimensional labeled arr ay.
◦DataFr ame: A DataFr ame is a two-dimensional labeled data structur e that consists of columns and
rows. A DataFr ame can be thought of as a spr eadsheet-like data structur e wher e each column
represents a Series. DataFr ame is a heter ogeneous data structur e wher e each column can have a
differ ent data type.
•Data pr ocessing functionality: Pandas pr ovides various functionalities for data pr ocessing, such as data
selection, filtering, slicing, sorting, mer ging, joining, and r eshaping.
•Integr ation with other libr aries: Pandas integr ates well with other Python libr aries, such as NumPy . The
integr ation capability allo ws for data e xchange between differ ent data analysis and visualization tools.
The conventional alias for importing Pandas is pd. In other wor ds, Pandas is imported as importpandasas

Explor atory data analysis
Explor atory Data Analysis (ED A)is the task of analyzing data to gain insights, identify patterns, and
understand the underlying structur e of the data. During ED A, data scientists visually and statistically e xamine
data to unco ver r elationships, anomalies, and tr ends, and to gener ate hypotheses for further analysis. The
main goal of ED A is to become familiar with the data and assess the quality of the data. Once data ar e
understood and cleaned, data scientists may perform featur e creation and hypothesis formation. A featur eis362 15 • Data Science

Data inde xing can be used to select and access specific r ows and columns. Data inde xing is essential in
examining a dataset. In Pandas, two types of inde xing methods e xist:
•Label-based inde xing using loc[]:loc[] allows you to access data in a DataFr ame using r ow/column
labels. Ex: df.loc[row_label, column_label] returns specific data at the intersection of row_label
and column_label .
•Integer-based inde xing using iloc[]:iloc[] allows you to access data in a DataFr ame using integer-based
inde xes. Integer inde xes can be passed to r etrie ve specific data. Ex: df.iloc[row_index,
column_index] returns specific data at the inde xrow_index and column_index .

Data slicing and filtering
Data slicing and filtering involve selecting specific subsets of data based on certain conditions or inde x/label
ranges. Data slicing refers to selecting a subset of r ows and/or columns fr om a DataFr ame. Slicing can be
performed using r anges, lists, or Boolean conditions.
•Slicing using r anges: Ex: df.loc[start_row:end_row, start_column:end_column] selects r ows and
columns within the specified r anges.
•Slicing using a list: Ex: df.loc[[label1, label2, ...], :] selects r ows that ar e in the list [label1,

•Slicing based on a condition: df[condition] selects only the r ows that meet the given condition .
Data filtering involves selecting r ows or columns based on certain conditions. Ex: In the e xpression
df[df['column_name' ] > threshold] , the DataFr ame dfis filter ed using the selection oper ator ( []) and
the condition( df['column_name' ] > threshold ) that is passed. All entries in the DataFr ame dfwher e the

Handling missing data
Missing values in a dataset can occur when data ar e not available or ar e not r ecor ded pr operly . Identifying and
remo ving missing values is an important step in data cleaning and pr eprocessing. A data scientist should
consider ethical consider ations thr oughout the ED A process, especially when handling missing data. The y
might consider answering questions such as " Why ar e the data missing?", " Whose data ar e missing?", and
"Considering the missing data, is the dataset still a r epresentative sample of the population under study ?". The
functions belo w ar e useful in understanding and analyzing missing data.
•isnull() : The isnull() function can be used to identify Null entries in a DataFr ame. The r eturn value of
the function is a Boolean DataFr ame, with the same dimensions as the original DataFr ame with True
values wher e missing values e xist.
•dropna() : The dropna() function can be used to dr op rows with Nullvalues.
•fillna() : The fillna() function can be used to r eplace Nullvalues with a pr ovided substitute value.
Ex:df.fillna(df.mean()) replaces all Nullvalues with the aver age value of the specific column.
To define a Nullvalue in a DataFr ame, you can use the np.nanvalue fr om the NumPy libr ary. Functions that
aid in identifying and r emo ving null entries ar e described in the table belo w the follo wing code.

Answer K ey
Chapter 1
1.1Backgr ound
1.b.Each image in the animation r epresents a differ ent type of computer pr ogram.
2.a.This type of analysis r equir es basic kno wledge of pr ogramming.
3.c.Like mobile apps, wi-fi speakers run small pr ograms that connect to servers.
4.b.This book assumes r eaders understand the basics of algebr a, but nothing too difficult.
5.c.Python 's syntax is mor e concise than Java 's.
6.a.Python does not r equir e a semicolon at the end of each line. Br aces ar e also not r equir ed.
1.2Input/output
1.c.The hello world pr ogram is just one line of code.
2.c.The end=""option r emo ves the ne wline char acter after hello, pr oducing Hello world! on the same
line.
3.c.The default space char acter that separ ates multiple items has been r eplaced with the dash char acter .
4.c.The user input is stor ed in memory and can be r eferenced using today_is .
5.b.The print()function outputs "You entered:" follo wed b y a space char acter , follo wed b y the input
data, Sophia, which is r eferenced b y the variable name.
6.a.The input is stor ed e xactly as the user enters the input. So, the r etrie ved value is displayed e xactly as
enter ed b y the user .
1.3Variables
1.c.This would pr oduce the output string, "The city where you live is Chicago" .
2.b.These two lines of code would pr oduce the output string, "Total = 6" .
3.c.The single =char acter is the assignment oper ator.
4.a.An assignment statement has the variable name on the left side and the value on the right side of the
assignment statement.
5.a.medianis a descriptive name for a variable that stor es a medianvalue.
6.b.A variable name can contain, but not start with, a digit.
7.c.The name clearly indicates the value being stor ed is a zip code.
8.a.Snake case separ ates each wor d with an underscor e and uses only lo wercase letters.
1.4String basics
1.c.A string that is enclosed b y matching double quotes is a valid string. Note that '7 days' is also a
string.
2.c.The string, fred78@gmail.com , is enclosed in matching double quotes, and is assigned to the variable
email. A string can contain char acters such as "@" or "." in addition to letters and numbers.
3.c.The string has matching double quotes. Since a single quote is a part of this string, double quotes must
be used.
4.c.Note that the enclosing single quotes (') ar e not part of the string but the double quotes (") ar e.
5.c.The len()function r eturns the number of char acters in the string. 6 char acters e xist in "Hi Ali"
which ar e "H", "i", " ", " A", "l", and "i".
6.b.The length of an empty string equals 0.
7.b.The number_of_digits variable 's value is 2, and as such, the output is "Number 12 has 2
digits." .
8.c.The 1and 0are enclosed in quotes indicating valid strings, and the + is not, indicating a concatenation
oper ation. Thus, the string "10"is pr oduced. Note that concatenation oper ator does not include any
default separ ator char acters like the space char acter .379
9.c."A"and "wake"are valid strings, and the + is not enclosed in quotes, indicating a concatenation
oper ation. Thus the string "Awake" is pr oduced. Note that the concatenation oper ator does not include
any default separ ator char acters like the space char acter .
10.c.Note that space char acters must be e xplicitly included when using the concatenation oper ator.
11.c.A concatenation of the two strings is assigned to the variable holiday. Note that "one-sided" would
assign the same string to holiday.
1.5Number basics
1.c.x =1is an integer , and when printing the type of an integer variable, the output is <class'int'>.
2.b.y =2.0is floating-point number .
3.a.Any value defined within quotation marks is a string value r egar dless of the content.
4.c.Line 2 of the code e valuates as follo ws:c = x - z = 7-2=5. Line 3 incr ements variable cby 1,
making the total equal to 6.
5.b.The output of 3.5-1.5equals 2.0, which is a floating-point number .
6.c.The r esult of the division oper ation is a floating-point number that isn 't rounded do wn.7/2=3.5.
7.c.The output of the 20/2equals 10.0because the division oper ation r esults in a float.
8.c.The output of an arithmetic oper ator on any floating-point oper and r esults in a floating-point value. 2*
1.5=3.0.
9.a.3 raised to the po wer 2 is 9, times 4 is 36, plus 1 is 37.
10.b.Although addition has lo wer pr ecedence than e xponentiation, the par entheses cause 1+3to be
evaluated first.
11.a.In Python, e xponentiation, or r aising to a po wer, has higher pr ecedence than making a value negative.
Python 's-16result can be confusing because, in math, "-4 squared" is16.
12.c.The statement uses the assignment oper ator ( =), the negative oper ator ( -), and the e xponentiation
oper ator ( **).
1.6Error messages
1.b.The filename can be found after the last slash (/). Other names, like Desktop, r efer to folders.
2.b.Line 2 is mentioned immediately after the filename.
3.b.The type of err or is always the first wor d on the last line of the err or message.
4.a.The middle thr ee lines ar e indented. In Python, lines may not begin with spaces or tabs une xpectedly .
5.c.The quote marks ar e missing at the end of the input pr ompt.
6.b.The name for "input" is misspelled.
1.7Comments
1.b.Comments help e xplain the purpose of code so that other pr ogrammers understand what the code
intends.
2.a.The hash char acter indicates the beginning of a comment.
3.b.Having one space after the # is the community standar d.
4.c.This comment e xplains the intent of the code. If the code had a mistake, the pr ogrammer r eading the
comment might notice the mistake mor e easily .
5.a.A blank line separ ates the input fr om the output.
Then again, inserting a blank line in a thr ee-line pr ogram is gener ally unnecessary .
6.c.The # symbol " comments out " the line without r emo ving the line permanently .
7.a.The docstring is primarily written for others who will use the pr ogram.
8.c.Docstrings must be a valid string, not a multi-line comment. Docstrings ar e stor ed in the pr ogram's
memory , but comments ar e ignor ed.
9.b.The amount of information in this docstring is just right. In most cases, the docstring should not be
longer than the code.380

1.8Why Python?
1.a.The language was named after Monty Python. Just for fun, the official documentation makes subtle
references to Monty Python comedy sketches.
2.b.Python 's first r elease was in 1991, after being de veloped in the late 1980' s.
3.c.Making Python open sour ce early on allo wed for many pr ogrammers to pr ovide feedback.
4.b.For 20 years, Java and C tr aded places as the top language until Python took o ver in 2021!
5.a.The line for Python cr osses the line for JavaScript in the middle of 2018.
6.b.TIOBE started tr acking language popularity in 2001, se veral years after web sear ch engines became
popular .
Chapter 2
2.1The Python shell
1.a.Most pr ogramming languages ar e high-le vel and meant to be understood b y humans.
2.c.The most basic line of Python code is a single e xpression, such as the integer 1.
3.b.After the input is stor ed in memory , the shell displays a pr ompt for the ne xt line.
4.c.The up arr ow displays the pr evious line, and the left arr ow mo ves within that line.
5.a.Pressing the up arr ow twice mo ves to the line befor e the pr evious line.
2.2Type conversion
1.a.book_rating was assigned with 3.5on line 5 and converted fr om an integer to a float b y the
interpr eter.book_rating isn't modified after line 5.
2.a.Combining a float and an integer in a calculation pr oduces a float. book_rating would be assigned
with 4.0.
3.a.A calculation with a float and an integer pr oduces a float. xis a float, 42.0, after the code e xecutes.
4.a.float()converts the input number of slices fr om a string to a float for the pizza or der calculation.
5.b.int()remo ves any fr actional part. Many calculations will pr oduce a fr actional part. Ex: 46 people with
3.0 slices per person will need 138 slices or 17.25 pizzas. int(17.25)is17, so adding 1produces 18
pizzas, a better estimate to ensur e enough pizza is or dered.

14.c.String repetition only works with strings and integers.381
2.4Floating-point err ors
1.b.An o verflo w err or occurs because the value is lar ger than the upper limit of the floating-point r ange.
2.a.The digits starting fr om the eighteenth place after the decimal ar e inaccur ate due to appr oximation, so

4.b.Code points 65 to 90 ar e used for upper case letters.
5.b.The code point for the char acter "0" is 48.
6.b.Tilde (~) is the char acter for code point 126. The chr()function r eturns a string of length one.
7.c.An escape sequence is two char acters long and begins with a backslash (\).
8.c.The first backslash indicates an escape sequence, and the second backslash indicates the char acter .
9.c.The escape sequence \nproduces a ne w line. print("Enter\nhere") produces the same r esult.
3.2Formatted strings
1.b.The same variable, says, is used in thr ee replacement fields.
2.a.The string is not an f-string, so the br ace char acters (ar ound temp and food) ar e printed liter ally.
3.c.Using an f-string allo ws the entir e output to be specified without commas and e xtra quote marks.
4.a.The format specifier 02dappends a 0 to the fr ont of the integer when the integer is only one digit.
5.c.The format specifier ".2f"(with a period) means fix ed-point, r ounded to two decimal places.
6.b.This format specifier is useful for displaying lar ge amounts of mone y.
3.3Variables r evisited
1.b.Each line of the pr ogram in the animation is an assignment statement.
2.c.The pr ogram assigns the int object 10and the float object 9.7, as sho wn in the memory diagr am.
3.a.An arr ow sho wswhich object a variable curr ently r efers to.
4.a.An object 's identity is an integer r epresenting the memory location.
5.c.The type function r eturns an object 's class name like int, float, or str .
6.b.A variable r efers to an object, so the variable 's value is the object 's value.
3.4List basics
1.b.A list of numbers can be set up using an assignment oper ator.
2.a.Individual elements in a list must be separ ated b y a comma. Python does not understand what is meant
by23.
3.c.Since inde xes start at 0, the r equir ed number is one less than the position being accessed.
4.a.The inde x -1 always r efers to the last element of a list. The e xpression len(name_list)- 1, which
evaluates to 3and r efers to the last element in a list of 4 elements, can also be used in place of -1 her e.
3.5Tuple basics
1.a.The first element, 2, is at inde x 0.
2.c.Tuples can have elements of the same type as well as elements of differ ent types.
3.a.A tuple must be cr eated using commas. Par entheses ar e optional but r ecommended. The thr ee
elements ar e"a","b", and "c".
4.b.my_tuple is initially assigned with the tuple (0.693,0.414,3.142). Then my_tuple is assigned
with the ne w tuple, (0.693,1.414,3.142), to corr ect a mistake with the second element.
5.a.Tuples ar e immutable. No changes, including appending, can be made after the tuple is cr eated.
6.b.Tuples ar e immutable, so attempted changes pr oduce err ors. Using a tuple would pr otect the constants
from accidental changes.383
Chapter 4
4.1Boolean values
1.c."True"uses quotation marks, so the value is a string.
2.b.is_vegetable is an integer and can be used in arithmetic oper ations.
3.a.A variable assigned with either TrueorFalseis a Boolean variable.
4.a.A Boolean variable r epresents the value TrueorFalse.
5.b.Trueand Falseare the only two values for a Boolean variable.
6.b.Assigning a bool with an intresults in implicit type conversion. The type conversion can cause issues
later in the code if the pr ogrammer assumes is_dessert is still a Boolean.
7.b.Any numeric type r epresenting 0 converts to False. Non-zer o numbers convert to True.
8.a.A negative number is non-zer o and converts to True.
9.b.The empty string is the only string that converts to False.
10.a."0" is a non-empty string and is converted to True.
11.a.The input is r ead in as a string, so bool("False")isTrue.
12.b.Trueconverted to a float is 1.0.Falseconverted to a float is 0.0.
13.b.Trueconverted to a string is "True". False converted to a string is "False" .
14.b.When a Boolean is converted to a numeric type, Trueis converted to 1, and Falseis converted to 0
.
15.b.14 is gr eater than 13, so 14 is not less than or equal to 13.
16.a.0 is less than 0.4, so 0 is not equal to 0.4.
17.b.4 is equal to 4.0, so 4 is not less than 4.0.
18.c.Numeric types cannot be compar ed to strings using the comparison oper ators: >, <, >=, <=. Using == or
!= will pr oduce a Boolean.
19.b.Strings ar e compar ed b y comparing each char acter 's Unicode values. Letters have ascending Unicode
values in alphabetical or der (and ar e case sensitive). "c"and "c"are equal, so "i"is compar ed to "o"
."i"is not equal to "o"soFalseis pr oduced, though cilantr o and coriander come fr om the same
plant.
20.b.Letters have ascending Unicode values in alphabetical or der (and ar e case sensitive). "d"is gr eater
than, not less than, "c", soFalseis pr oduced.
4.2If-else statements
1.b.age <12is between "if"and ":" and is an e xpression that e valuates to TrueorFalse.
2.c.The pr ogram e xecutes the body when the condition is true.
3.b.The body , line 3, isn 't executed because the condition is false.
4.c.-10<0is true, so numis assigned with 25. Then 25<100, sonumis assigned with 25+50, which is
75.
5.b.Line 4 is not indented, so positive_num is always assigned with 0. The positive input value is lost.
6.c.The ifbranch is taken when x >=15, so the elsebranch is taken when xis not gr eater than or equal
to15.
7.a.40>30, so the body of the ifstatement is e xecuted. y =40-10=30.
8.b.One of the br anches is always taken in an if-elsestatement. Depending on x's value, ywill either
have a final value of 30or105.
4.3Boolean oper ations
1.a.2500<3000isTrue, and 2.5>1.0isTrue, so Jaden can enter .
2.b.3000>3000isFalse. False and T rue is False.FalseandFalseisFalse. So no value of
hrs_to_close will allo w Dar cy to enter .
3.b.FalseandTrueisFalse.384
Access for fr ee at openstax.or g
4.b.(8<10)and(21>20)evaluates to TrueandTrue, which is True. So the body of the ifis
executed, and zis assigned with 5.
5.a.(21<30)orFalseevaluates to TrueorFalse, which is True.
6.c.The discount does not apply for ages between 12 and 65 inclusive.
7.a.(9%2==0and10%2==1)evaluates to (FalseandFalse), which is False.(9%2==1and10%2
==0)evaluates to (TrueandTrue), which is True.FalseorTrueisTrue. The ifstatement
checks whether the numbers form an e ven-odd or odd-e ven pair .
8.a.not(13<10)evaluates to not(False), which is True.
9.b.not(18>15and18<20)evaluates to not(TrueandTrue), then not(True), and finally ,False
.
10.a.65>60isTrue, sois_turnis assigned with not(False), which is True.
4.4Oper ator pr ecedence
1.b.Exponentiation has the highest pr ecedence, then division, then addition.
2.a.Multiplication has the highest pr ecedence, then gr eater than, then not.
3.b.Division has the highest pr ecedence, then equality and less than, then and.
4.b.Multiplication and division have the highest pr ecedence, ar e left associative, and have higher
precedence than addition.
5.b.Exponentiation is right associative and has higher pr ecedence than multiplication.
6.c.The e xpression is valid and is separ ated into comparisons connected with and.
7.a.The equality oper ator, ==, has higher pr ecedence than the logical and.
8.a.The e xpression is e valuated as x + (3*y) -5.8+ (3*9) -5=30.
9.b.The e xpressions in par entheses ar e evaluated first. (8+3) * (9-5) =11*4=44.
4.5Chained decisions
1.b.elifwill e valuate condition_2 ifcondition_1 isFalseand e xecute Body2ifcondition_2 is
True.
2.b.x >44,42>44, isFalse, sox <50is evaluated. 42<50isTrue, soy =0+5. Only one of the
ifand elifbranches is taken.
3.a.Ifx <0,Body1executes. Else if x ==0,Body2executes.
4.a.The elifmust be chained to a pr eceding statement and at the same indentation le vel.
5.c.The ifand if-elifstatements ar e not chained. The first ifevaluates to Trueand e xecutes. Then
theif-elifis evaluated and the elifbranch e xecutes.
6.b.The thir d branch e xecutes if hour <8andhour <12isFalseand hour <13isTrue.
7.c.Anelifcan be chained to another elifto form a longer chained decision.
8.a.Only one br anch is e xecuted in a chained decision statement. -1<0and-2<0isTrue, soy =
10.
9.c.The first br anch e xecutes if price < 9.99. The second br anch e xecutes if price < 19.99and the first
condition fails: that is, price >= 9.99. The thir d branch e xecutes if the first and second conditions fail:
that is, price >= 19.99. Chaining can simplify decision statements.
4.6Nested decisions
1.c.leaf_count == 3isFalse, so the outer else's body is e xecuted.
2.c.num_dancers is positive, so the elsebranch is taken. num_dancers is odd, so the err or is printed
befor e the pr ogram continues after the nested ifand prints num_dancers .
3.b.256==513isFalse, and 256<513isTrue, so the elifbranch is taken and Body2executes.
513>=512isTrue, soBody3executes.
4.c.The first elseisn't indented and is tr eated as the elseto the original if. Thus the second elseis
not connected to an ifstatement and pr oduces an err or.385
4.7Conditional e xpressions
1.c.The conditional e xpression will assign response with "even"ifxis even. response is assigned with
"odd"ifxis odd.
2.a.100<100isFalsesoresultis assigned with x - offset = 100-10=90.
3.c.min_numcannot be assigned with min_num = y . The corr ect e xpression is min_num = x if x < y
else y"
4.b.Conditional e xpressions that e valuate to a Boolean ar e redundant. The Boolean e xpression should be
used instead.
5.b.The e xpression is e valuated as (fee +10)ifhours > 12else2. So if hours > 12, the r esult will
be fee + 10; otherwise, the r esult will be 2.
Chapter 5
5.1While loop
1.b.The loop runs six times for values of g =1,2,3,5,8, and 13.
2.c.21 is the first Fibonacci number lar ger than 20, and for g =21, the condition will e valuate to Falsefor
the first time.
3.a.The code first prints the variable f's initial value. Then, at each iter ation, g's value is printed, and g's
value thr oughout the code 's execution will be 1,2,3,5,8, and 13. Thus, all printed values ar e1,1
,2,3,5,8, and 13.
4.b.The loop runs for n =4,3,2,1.
5.b.The loop 's termination condition is n =0; ther efore, the value of nafter the loop equals 0. The last
printed line will be: value of n after the loop is0.
6.c.Since the initialization value for nequals 4and the value of nis only incr easing, the loop condition will
always r emain true. The loop will ne ver terminate.
5.2For loop
1.b.Eight char acters e xist in the str_var. Iter ating o ver all char acters and incr ementing the value of count
variable at each iter ation r esults in the count'svalue of 8.
2.a.Since the initial count's value is 0, multiplying countby any number r esults in the output of 0.
3.c.The added line prints each char acter that is looped on (char acter c), and prints an additional * after the
char acter .
4.a.The output will be an incr easing sequence between 10and 22(inclusive of both): 10,13,16,19,
and 22.
5.c.The e xpression starts a sequence fr om5, decr eases b y 1 at e very step, and ends at 1.
6.a.The range()function gener ates a descending sequence, beginning fr om-1until -2. Hence, the output
is-1.
7.c.When the step size is negative, the gener ated sequence will be in descending or der. Hence, startmust
be lar ger than end; otherwise, no sequence will be gener ated.
8.c.When two ar guments ar e provided to the range()function, ar guments ar e consider ed as startand
endof the sequence, and the step size will be 1. When step size is positive, the gener ated sequence will
be in ascending or der, and hence, startmust be less than end. Otherwise, no sequence will be
gener ated.
5.3Nested loops
1.b.The combination of iand jvalues, (i, j), that meet the inner and outer loop conditions ar e as
follo ws:
(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4),
(2,1), (2,2), (2,3),386
Access for fr ee at openstax.or g
(3,1), (3,2),
(4,1)
2.b.Each inner loop 's full e xecution prints thr ee "*" char acters, and the outer loop e xecutes twice.
3.b.Each line iof the output ( i =1,2,3, and 4) contains itimes values 1through 4.
Hence, the outer loop e xecutes while i <=4, and the inner loop iter ates o verjwhile j's value is less than
or equal to 4.
4.a.The outer loop 's execution r ange is 0,1, and 2; hence, the outer loop e xecutes thr ee times.
5.b.The inner loop is e valuated four times ( j =0,1,2, and 3) for e very i's value set b y the outer loop.
In the given e xample i =0,1, and 2; hence, the total number of times the inner loop e xecutes is 3*
4=12.
6.c.The printed output displays thr ee rows with each r owidisplaying i* values in the r ange of 0to3.
Hence, the code must iter ate o ver r ow ID in the outer loop, and in each r ow, iter ate o ver elements' ID in
the r ange of 0to3.
5.4Break and continue
1.c.The code prints all char acters befor e the first occurr ence of a space char acter in separ ate lines. Hence
the output is:
H
e
l
l
o
2.b.As soon as the printstatement is e xecuted, the breakstatement causes the loop 's termination. Also,
fori =15, the condition (i%3==0andi%5==0)is met, and hence the print statement will be
executed e xactly once.
3.b.The loop finds the first five numbers that ar e divisible b y2or3. These numbers ar e2,3,4,6,
and 8, and thus 8is the final i's value.
4.b.The print statement is e xecuted for numbers within the r ange of 0 and 10 (inclusive) that ar e divisible b y
3. The printed output is:
9
6
3
0
5.b.The loop checks whether the char acter being e valuated is a space char acter or not. If so, the r emainder
of the loop will be skipped and the space char acter will not be printed.
5.5Loop else
1.b.The variable iis initialized to 16, and the whileloop e xecutes with i =16,8,4, and 2. In each
loop 's iter ation, the variable exp's value is incr emented b y 1. Hence, at the end of the loop, exp =4. Since
the loop terminates without interruption, the elsestatement after the loop is e xecuted and prints 16is
2to the4.
2.a.The initial i's value is 7. Hence, in the first loop 's iter ation, the elsestatement within the loop
executes, and the breakstatement terminates the loop. Since the loop 's execution is interrupted, the
elseafter the loop will not e xecute and ther e will be no output.
3.b.The loop iter ates o ver all integer values in the list. If a value is less than 5, the value will be printed, and
if the value is gr eater than 5, the code prints " Notallnumbers are less than 5." and the code 's387
execution terminates.
Chapter 6
6.1Defining functions
1.c.The print()function is called to output the variable, offset_num .
2.b.Lines 1, 4, and 5 each call print()once. Lines 2 and 3 call a differ ent function, input().
3.b.Line 1 is a comment that is not e xecuted. Lines 2 and 3 each call float()and input(). Line 3 calls
print()for a total of five function calls.
4.b.The corr ected line is defwater_plant ():.
5.c.The main pr ogram outputs "User info:" and then calls print_phone_num() , which outputs the
phone number .
6.b.A function call includes the function name and par entheses.
7.a.calc_tax is concise, in snake case, and indicates the function 's task.
8.c.Each calculation uses four statements to r ead in the x,y values of a pair of points. The original pr ogram
performs thr ee calculations b y repeating code for a total of 12 input statements. The r evised pr ogram
performs thr ee calculations b y executing the four input statements multiple times with function calls.
9.c.The benefits of a function 's reusability is highlighted b y many function calls that dr astically r educe the
amount of clutter ed, r edundant code. Calling calc_distance() 10 times is equivalent to 60 statements
in the original pr ogram.
6.2Contr ol flo w
1.c.Line 5 is the start of the main pr ogram, which is not indented. park_greet() is called on line 6 and
executed.
2.b.Contr ol flo w mo ves to wher epark_greet() is defined, at line 4.
3.c.Contr ol flo w returns to the line that called the function. Line 12 contains the function call to
extra_lot() , so contr ol flo w returns to line 12.
4.c.The pr ogram has an indentation mistake. print("Open ..." )is unindented, so the statement is not a
part of park_greet() and is e xecuted first. Then, park_greet() is called, and print("Welcome ..." )
is executed.
5.c.The forloop has thr ee iter ations. Each iter ation calls print_book_club() , which calls print_conf() .
So the pr ogram calls print_book_club() three times and print_conf() three times.
6.b.Contr ol flo w returns to line 11, which called print_conf() . Then print_book_club() finishes, and
contr ol flo w returns to line 16, which called print_book_club() .
6.3Variable scope
1.c.Both numand num_sqare created outside of functions and ar e global variables.
2.a.numis created outside of a function and is global. num_sqis created in print_square() and is not
global.
3.c.numis global and can be accessed anywher e in the pr ogram, including both print_double() and
print_square() .
4.b.out_stris the only variable declar ed in print_time() and is a local variable.
5.c.out_stris accessed in print_greeting() but cr eated in statements outside of print_greeting() .
6.b.print_time() creates out_stras a local variable. out_stris only in scope in print_time() and
cannot be accessed else wher e.
7.a.The global variable hour is not edited in update_hour() .tmpis the local variable edited. tmpis
discar ded after update_hour() finishes.
8.c.new_hour is a local variable that the print statement tries to access after update_hour() finishes.
new_hour is out of scope, so an err or is pr oduced.388
Access for fr ee at openstax.or g
9.b.The globalkeywor d can be used to cr eate a global variable fr om within a function. new_hour has
global scope and can be accessed outside update_hour() .
6.4Parameters
1.b.username is the ar gument passed to print_welcome() .nameisprint_welcome() 's par ameter that
is assigned with username 's value.
2.a.nameis the only par ameter defined with print_welcome() .username is the ar gument passed on line
5's function call.
3.a.nameis a par ameter that e xists only within a call to print_welcome() .
4.a.The pr ogram would run corr ectly . Arguments and par ameters can have the same name, and a local
variable called namewould still be cr eated in print_welcome() . Scope can be confusing with variables of
the same name.
5.a.p1_xis the first ar gument used in line 9' s function call. x1is defined as the first par ameter of
calc_distance() .
6.b.y1is defined as calc_distance() 's second par ameter .p1_yis the second ar gument on line 9' s
function call.
7.c.3is a liter al passed as the thir d argument, which corr esponds to x2, the thir d par ameter .
8.a.A list is mutable, so the object r eferr ed to b ywknd_temps and tempsis modified without needing a
local cop y.
9.b.A string is immutable, so convert_temps() makes a ne w object for unitto refer to.
10.a.An immutable object 's value cannot be changed.
11.b.unitno longer e xists after convert_temps() finishes and r eturns to line 14.
6.5Return values
1.a.calc_mpg() specifies mpgto be r eturned with the returnstatement.
2.b.returnis a valid statement to end the function and r eturn to the calling code without a specified value.
calc_sqft() should r eturn sqftwith the line returnsqft.
3.c.If the r eturn value or returnstatement is not specified, the function r eturns None.
4.b.num ==3isTrue, so the return"dk"statement e xecutes.
5.a.Forinc_volume( 9,10),returnlevelreturns 9, and level += 1is ne ver r eached.
6.b.bill += tax(bill) + auto_tip(bill) evaluates to bill += 6.0+20.0tobill =100.0+
6.0+20.0to 126.0.
7.a.val2 = sq(offset( 5))evaluates to val2 = sq( 3)to 9.
6.6Keywor d arguments
1.d.The function call uses all ke ywor d arguments to assign values to the named par ameters.
2.b."Hiya"is the value of msgand "Ash"is the value of namein the function.
3.a."Welcome" is unnamed and assigned corr ectly to count. Positional ar guments must come befor e
keywor d arguments.
4.b.The positional ar guments, "Hi"and "Bea", follo w the ke ywor d argument count=1, which pr oduces
an err or.
5.b.name's default value is "Friend" , and count's default value is 1.msgdoes not have default value.
6.c.msgis a r equir ed ar gument assigned with "Greetings" .nameand countuse the default values.
"Greetings Friend" is printed.
7.b.msg="Hello",name="Friend" , and count=0, so the call is valid. The function e xecutes but doesn 't
enter the forloop because count=0.389
Chapter 7
7.1Module basics
1.b.The code has ten defstatements, each of which defines a function.
2.a.Many modules consist of function definitions only . The functions ar e intended to be called in other
modules.
3.c.area.cube( 5)is6*5**2, which is 6*25, which is 150.
4.a.When importing a module fr om another file, the suffix .pyis remo ved.
5.b.The cir cle function must be called using the ar ea variable that r efers to the module.
6.b.Adding the function to the ar ea module makes the function easier to r euse in other pr ograms.
7.2Importing names
1.a.This statement imports the sqrt function defined in the math module.
2.b.A variable is defined for each function imported: sin, cos, and tan.
3.b.A name err or occurs when a variable name is not found, which might be due to a missing import
statement.
4.b.This statement r eplaces the pr eviously imported cir cle function, e ven though circle() and
area.circle() have differ ent par ameters.
5.a.Assigning the ar ea variable r eplaces the pr eviously imported module with the integer 51. The variable
can no longer be used to call functions in the ar ea module.
6.b.The most r ecent definition of hello()requir es one ar gument, so this line would r esult in an err or.
7.3Top-le vel code
1.b.Whene ver this module is imported, Python will output "Defining sphere function" as a side effect.
2.a.Even though nothing is printed, calling the spher e function ten million times causes a delay in the main
program.
3.a.All code is at the top le vel, and no functions ar e defined. Importing this module would run all code as a
side effect.
4.c.The variable __name__ is the module 's name, unless the module was run as the main pr ogram. In that
case, __name__ is"__main__" .
5.a.Since test.p ywas imported, the value of __name__ is"test".
6.c.This line is found in many Python modules to check if the module was run as the main pr ogram.
7.4The help function
1.b.The digits have 0 r ed and 0 gr een, so the color must be a shade of blue. Navy is a darker version of
standar d blue, #0000FF .
2.c.FF in he xadecimal is 255, the maximum amount of r ed, gr een, or blue in a color .
3.a.The r ed, gr een, and blue values for or ange ar e higher than the r ed, gr een, and blue values for gr een.
4.b.The he xadecimal for YELL OW is #FFFF00 , meaning 255 r ed + 255 gr een + 0 blue.
5.c.Both the darkenfunction and the BLUEvariable must be accessed via the colorsvariable.
6.a.Function names that begin with an underscor e are intended to be used only within the curr ent module.
7.b.Only docstrings ar e included in the documentation. All comments ar e ignor ed b y the help function.
8.a.The functions ar e sorted alphabetically b y name to make looking up a function easier .
9.a.Functions that begin with an underscor e are intended to be used only within a module, not in other
modules.
7.5Finding modules
1.a.This r eference describes the standar d libr ary, including built-in functions, types, and modules.
2.b.As explained in the documentation of the calendar module, MONDAYis0and SUNDAYis6.
3.a.The tkintermodule stands for Tk interface. Tk is a standar d toolkit for cr eating windo ws, te xt bo xes,390
Access for fr ee at openstax.or g
buttons, and other gr aphical widgets.
4.c.MoviePyis a module for video editing, and Pillowis a module for image pr ocessing.
5.a.Accor ding to the "Featur es" section of the documentation, Arrow's is a "fully-implemented, dr op-in
replacement for datetime ."
6.a.This function converts a color code to a color name. Ex: hex_to_name( "#daa520" )returns
"goldenrod" .
Chapter 8
8.1String oper ations
1.a.Since a's ASCII value is less than b's ASCII value, the output for "aaa"<"aab"is True.
2.b.Since "a"is shorter than "aa", and the pr efix "aa"with length 1 equals the second oper and ( "a"
), the shorter string is consider ed smaller . As such, "aa"<"a"evaluates to False.
3.c.While all char acters in "aples" exist in "apples" , the char acters ar e not sequential, so the string
"aples" is not a substring of "apples" . Ther efore,"aples" in"apples" returns False.
4.a."aBbA".lower() converts all char acters to lo wercase, and the output is "abba".
5.b."aBbA".upper() converts all char acters to upper case, and the output is "ABBA".
6.a.The upper()converts "a"to upper case ( "A"). When checking "a".upper() == "A", the output is
True.
8.2String slicing
1.b.Since inde xing starts fr om 0, the char acter at inde x 1 is the second char acter in the string, which is "e"
.
2.b.Since negative inde xing starts fr om -1 fr om the right of the string to the left, "u"is at inde x -2.
3.a.Char acter "e"in the string "chance" has inde x of -1 (negative inde xing) and 5 (positive inde xing).
4.b.a_string[ 2:4]is a slice including the thir d and fourth char acters, which is "ll".
5.b.The slice [-3:-1]includes char acters at inde x -3 and -2, which ar e"oo".
6.b.The string slice of greeting[ 3:]is the substring starting fr om inde x 3 up to the end of the string,
which is "Leila" .
7.b.To modify string content, a ne w variable must be cr eated with desir ed modifications.
8.a.Attempting to assign a value to an inde x or r ange of inde xes in a string r esults in TypeError: 'str'
objectdoesnotsupport item assignment .
9.c.The char acter at inde x 1,"o", is replacing the content of variable str. As such, the print statement
prints "o".
8.3Sear ching/testing strings
1.c.Since "a"is a substring of "an umbrella" , the output of "a"in"an umbrella" isTrue.
2.b."ab"is not a substring of "arbitrary" ; hence, the output is False.
3.a.Since ""is a substring of length 0 for "string" , the output is True.
4.a.The forloop iter ates thr ough the char acters in "string" and prints all char acter without any
separ ator char acter .
5.c.The given code iter ates o ver char acters in string "abca", and each time char acter "a"is observed, a
counter variable is incr eased b y 1. Since "a"appears twice in "abca", the output will be 2.
6.c.The code iter ates o ver the char acters in "cab"and prints each char acter 's upper case equivalent.
Ther efore, the output is "CAB".
7.c."aaa".count("a")returns 3, which is the number of occurr ences of "a"in string "aaa".
8.a.Zero occurr ence of "b"exists in "weather" ; hence, the output of "weather" .count("b")is0.
9.b.Two substrings "aa"exist in "aaa", one starting fr om inde x 0 and one starting fr om inde x 1.
10.a.The find()method r eturns the inde x for the first occurr ence of the substring in the given string. The391
inde x for the first occurr ence of "a"is 1.
11.b.Since "c"is not a substring in "banana" , the find()method r eturns -1.
12.a.Since "banana" is not a substring of "b",-1is returned.
13.a.The index()method r eturns the inde x of the start of the first occurr ence of a substring in the given
string. The inde x of the first occurr ence of "o"in"school" is 3.
14.c.Substring "ooo"does not e xist in the string "ooo"and hence the index()method r eturns a
ValueError .
15.a.sentence.index( " ")returns the inde x of the first space char acter . The print statement prints the
prefix of the sentence ending just befor e the first space char acter , so the output is "This".
8.4String formatting
1.c."Ana"is substituted for the r eplacement field {} in the template and hence the output is "Hello
Ana!".
2.b.The two ar guments ar e passed to the template "{}:{}" that outputs "One:1" .
3.a.The ar guments for the format()function ar e passed in or der and will be substituted for the
replacement fields. Additional ar guments may be ignor ed b y the template and r emain unused.
4.c."Bengio" is substituted in the named r eplacement field associated with the tag name; hence, the
output is "Hey Bengio!" .
5.b.Since the string template uses a named ar gument, inputs ar e only accepted thr ough the corr esponding
keys. Hence, the code gener ates KeyError: 'name'.
6.b.The gr eeting variable with value "Hi"is substituted for the gr eeting r eplacement field. The same is
also done for the name r eplacement field and the name variable. The output is "Hi Jess" .
7.b.The template specifies the minimum length for the namefield to be 12, so len(formatted_name) is12
.
8.c.The alignment and the field length specifications format the greeting field to be six char acters in
length and right-aligned. Ther efore, the variable formatted_greeting will take value " Hello" , and
char acter 0 of the string is a space char acter .
9.c.The field length specification enfor ces the minimum length of the string. Inputs that ar e longer than the
specified minimum length will not be modified.
10.c.The .3format specification sho ws that the output pr ecision must be thr ee decimal places.
11.a.The {:1>3d}specification outputs a 3-digit number in the output, and if the given ar gument does not
have thr ee digits, the number will be padded with 1' s from the left side.
12.b.{:+d}formats the decimal number b y adding the positive sign.
8.5Splitting/joining strings
1.b.When "1*2*3*" is br oken into substrings using the '*'delimiter , the output is ["1","2","3"].
2.c.When "a year includes 12 months" is br oken into substrings using blank space char acters, the list
["a","year","includes" ,"12","months" ]is created.
3.b.When splitting the multi-line string, the output is ['This','is','a','test'].
4.c.Elements of the list elements are concatenated together using a comma, so the output is
'A,beautiful,day,for,learning' .
5.b.The output of "sss".join(["1","2"])is"1sss2" , which has a length of 5.
6.b.Since the separ ator is an empty string, elements of the list will be concatenated without a separ ator and
the output will be "12".
Chapter 9
9.1Modifying and iter ating lists
1.b.The append() oper ation adds an element to the end of a list.392
Access for fr ee at openstax.or g
2.c.The element to be r emo ved is passed as a par ameter to the r emo ve oper ation. The r emo ve is performed
on the specified list.
3.c.Both pop()and remove() can be used to r emo ve the last element of a list. pop()automatically
remo ves the last element, wher easremove() requir es the last element be specified.
4.a.The length of the list is 5, so the iter ative forloop e xecutes five times.
5.b.len(my_list) is 5. A counting forloop ends at 1 less than the second value in the r ange function, so
the final value of iis4.
6.a.The forloop steps b y two each time, so inde x 0, 2, and 4 ar e printed. Due to the "end="in the print
statement, all elements ar e printed on one line.
9.2Sorting and r eversing lists
1.b.Sorting in descending or der means to arr ange the elements fr om lar gest to smallest. -3 is the smallest
element of the list and would be the last element when the list is sorted in descending or der.
2.a.For strings, ascending or der r efers to dictionary or der.
3.c.In alphabetical or der, "h" comes befor e "k". The first four char acters ar e the same, so "flash" comes
befor e"flask" .
4.b.The sort()function must be applied on the list. The default for the sort()function is to arr ange
elements in ascending or der.
5.a.The corr ect syntax for the reverse() function r equir es the function to be applied to the list.
6.a."go"is the first element of board_games , so"go"would be the last element once board_games is
reversed.
9.3Common list oper ations
1.a.The min()function takes a list as a par ameter and r eturns the minimum for the list.
2.b."Austin City Limits" is the first string in dictionary or der.
3.c.The summation of the given floats is 12.4.
4.c.list2refers to the same list as my_list, so any changes made to list2also r eflect on my_list. 18 is
the summation of the values in the list.
5.a.3 is the maximum value in the list my_list. Line 3 changes the value of the first element in list2.
6.b.sum()function is not defined for string values.
9.4Nested lists
1.a.Each r ow of the matrix is r epresented as a list in the lar ger list-of-lists, matA.matArepresents the
complete matrix.
2.c.6 is in the 2nd r ow and 3r d column. Using zer o-inde xing r esults in inde x 1 for the r ow and 2 for the
column.
3.c.The first element of the list matAis a list [7,4,5]representing the first r ow of the matrix.
4.a.The outer forloop iter ates r ow by row. The inner forloop iter ates thr ough each element in a r ow. So
all the numbers ar e printed, starting fr om 7 and ending in -5.
5.c.The outer forloop runs for thr ee iter ations because ther e are thr ee elements in the list-of-lists. The
inner forloop iter ates thr ough each element of each r ow using the length of each r ow.
9.5List compr ehensions
1.a.The e xpression tells Python what element to put in the ne w list.
2.c.i+2results in adding 2 to each element of a_listto gener ateb_list.
3.b.The forloop starts at 1 and steps b y thr ee, so it begins at 1 and ends at 13. Dividing using the //
oper ator r esults in dr opping the part after the decimal.
4.c.The list compr ehension filters for negative numbers in my_list.
5.b.The list compr ehension selects vo wels fr om the given string.393
6.a.The forloop r anges fr om 0 thr ough 20, stepping b y two, but each iter ated element is e ven, so nothing
is added to new_list .
Chapter 10
10.1 Dictionary basics
1.a.The first item in each ke y-value pair is the ke y. Hence "Sunday" ,"Monday" ,"Tuesday" are key
items.
2.b.The second item in each ke y-value pair is the value. Hence 1,2,3are value items.
3.b.Based on the daysdictionary object, the value assigned to "Sunday" is1.
4.b.The type of a dictionary object is dict.
5.b.A dictionary cannot have duplicate ke ys, and "a"and "A"are two differ ent ke ys because "a"and "A"
are differ ent char acters.
6.a.A dictionary can have duplicate values, but not duplicate ke ys.
10.2 Dictionary cr eation
1.b.Curly br aces can be used to cr eate an empty dictionary .
2.c.{"one":1}creates a dictionary object with one item "one":1.
3.b.Two pairs of items e xist in the my_dictdictionary . The two pairs ar e"a":1and "b":2.
4.b.dict()function, along with ke ywor d arguments, can be used to cr eate a dictionary object.
5.a.my_dictis a dictionary with one ke y-value pair ,"a":1.
6.b.The dict()function can cr eate a dictionary object fr om a list of tuples. The first element of each tuple
acts as the ke y, and the second element is the value.
10.3 Dictionary oper ations
1.c.The value associated with the ke y"Jaya"is"Student" .
2.b.When a ke y does not e xist in a dictionary ,Noneis returned b y default.
3.b.The second ar gument to the get()function will be r eturned if the ke y is not found in the dictionary .
4.a.The r eturn type of keys()function is dict_keys .
5.c.The values in the numbers dictionary ar e1,2, and 3. When printing numbers.values() ,
dict_values([ 1,2,3])is printed.
6.b.Keys in the dictionary ar e"one","two","three". Using the list()constructor , a list object
containing all ke ys is r eturned.
7.c.When accessing a dictionary ke y and assigning a ne w value, the associated value for the ke y will be
updated.
8.b.Using the delkeywor d, items can be deleted fr om a dictionary using the ke y.
9.a.The update() function modifies the value associated with the ke y"Kabob" and adds a ne w item,
"Sushi":"$16".
10.4 Conditionals and looping in dictionaries
1.a."apple" is a ke y in the dictionary and e xists in the r eturned ke ys fr omfruit_count.keys() .
2.b.The ke y"orange" , with associated value 5, exists in the dictionary and the r eturn value is True.
3.b.Conditional statements can be written to e xamine ke ys and values.
4.b.The values() method iter ates o ver values in a dictionary .
5.a.The loop iter ates o ver the ke ys"apple" ,"orange" , and "banana" , and prints the ke ys space-
separ ated.
6.c.The loop multiplies all values b y 2 and prints the output. So, 4,10, and 2are printed.394
Access for fr ee at openstax.or g
10.5 Nested dictionaries and dictionary compr ehension
1.b.A nested dictionary contains another dictionary .
2.c.Both outer and inner ke ys must be used to inde x into both outer and inner dictionaries, r espectively , to
obtain an inner value.
3.b.A nested dictionary is a value of another dictionary , representing the data in a two-layer structur e.
4.b.Keys in the dictionary ar e even values in the list numbers, and associated values ar e the po wers of two.
5.a.Dictionary ke ys ar e string values in the nameslist, and associated values ar e the length of each string.
6.a.The dictionary is cr eated fr om ke y values fr om 0 up to and including 3. The associated values ar e po wers
of two of the ke ys.
Chapter 11
11.1 Object-oriented pr ogramming basics
1.b.Ellis' s username r epresents the post cr eator .
2.b.An object models a r eal-world entity with fields and pr ocedur es.
3.a.A procedur e, such as Change venue , can make changes to the field and pr otect the field fr om
inappr opriate access.
4.b.Limiting data access pr events accidental changes and makes r elationships between objects clear er.
5.b.Corr ect abstr action makes only necessary information visible. An o verheated engine can cause
irrepar able damage, so an indicator is necessary for the driver .
6.a.Showing only the necessary information r educes clutter and impr oves the o verall experience.
11.2 Classes and instances
1.a.Catfollo ws the class ke ywor d at the top of the class definition and is the name of the class.
2.c.pet_1is an instance of the Catclass cr eated b y calling Cat(). The other instance is pet_2.
3.a.breedis an instance attribute defined in__init__() . The other instance attributes ar enameand age.
4.c.CapWords style, with all wor ds capitalized and no spaces between wor ds, is r ecommended for class
names. "Pet " and " cat" are separ ate wor ds, so each is capitalized and one dir ectly follo ws the other .
5.b.Two instances, room_1and room_3, are created b y calling Rectangle() , which calls the constructor
__init__() .
6.b.room_1is the instance that called the method area(), soselfrepresents the specific instance.
7.a.Line 3 is in __init__() , which initializes length and the other instance attributes for each ne w instance.
8.c.__init__() has one r equir ed par ameter , conventionally called self, which allo ws the constructor to
access the instance.
9.b.order_id is an instance attribute defined in __init__() . The other instance attribute is cup_size .
10.b.Changing order_1.cup_size does not affect order_3.cup_size. order_1.cup_size changes to 8
and order_3.cup_size is still 16.
11.a.order_1,order_2, and order_3all shar e the class attribute CoffeeOrder.loc . Changing locaffects
all instances, so Caffeine Cafe is printed as the location.
12.b.Trying to access a class attribute using an instance is unsafe. In __init__() , trying to access the class
attribute cr eates a ne w instance attribute called cls_id. Though possible, pr ogrammers should avoid
using the same name for class attributes and instance attributes to avoid confusion.
11.3 Instance methods
1.b.Remo ving the default par ameter value makes bpa requir ed par ameter .
2.b.selfis the first par ameter in __init__() definition, not an e xplicit ar gument. selfshould not be
included in the call.
3.c.The second definition o verwrites the first as multiple e xplicit definitions of __init__() aren't allo wed.
__init__() requir es all par ameters, so the first two __init__() calls for patient_1 and patient_2395
are incorr ect.
4.c.order_1is originally a coffee without milk or sugar , but the call to change() adds sugar to the or der b y
assigning order_1.with_sugar with True.
5.c.An instance method' s first par ameter indicates the method can change an instance. change() allows a
change in whether a coffee or der has milk or sugar .
6.b.Unindenting print_order() would pr oduce an err or. An instance method must be defined in the class.
11.4 Overloading oper ators
1.c.__add__() is a magic method, indicated b y the double underscor es at the start and end of the method
name.
2.b.Magic methods ar e designed to be invoked internally to perform under-the-hood actions to simplify
tasks for the user .
3.c.__init__() is defined b y the pr ogrammer to initialize instance attributes. __str__() is defined b y the
programmer to customize an Engineer instance 's string r epresentation.
4.a.A programmer can o verload an oper ator to customize the built-in oper ator 's function.
5.b.The addition oper ation maps the left oper and, acct_a, to the par ameter selfand the right oper and,
acct_b, to the par ameter other.
6.c.- is a binary oper ator, so__sub__() has two par ameters. The par ameters' xand yattributes ar e
subtr acted fr om each other , and the r esulting values ar e made into a ne wPair.
7.a.<, >, and == ar e overloaded with __lt__() ,__gt__() , and __eq__() , respectively .
8.b.__le__() is the magic method for the <= oper ator.__le__() takes two par ameters for the left and
right oper and, and r eturns the corr ect comparison of the two amount values.
9.b.__gt__() overloads the > oper ator, which makes a comparison and r eturns TrueorFalse.
11.5 Using modules with classes
1.b.Leveland XPare classes imported fr om the char acter module into the pr ogram. Any other class in the
char acter module is not imported.
2.b.A single class or multiple classes can be imported fr om a module using the class name(s).
3.c.The number of classes in a module is unlimited, but classes should be gr ouped in modules to maximize
reusability .
4.b.The char acter module is aliased as game_char , so char acter is not defined in the pr ogram. game_char
is used in place of char acter .
5.c.game_char referr ed to the imported module, but assigning game_char replaces the imported module
with the string 'Ranger' .game_char can no longer be used to access classes.
Chapter 12
12.1 Recursion basics
1.a.The mo ve of the smaller ring, which is a smaller pr oblem, is done twice on the way to solving for the two
rings o verall. The task of mo ving all thr ee rings is br oken do wn into smaller tasks of mo ving one ring at a
time.
2.b.The two-ring solution fr om question 1 is used in the solution for thr ee rings.
3.b.Once to mo ve two rings to the middle to wer follo wing the rules, then to mo ve two rings to the tar get
tower.
4.c.The small ring is mo ved to the middle to wer. The bigger ring is mo ved to the tar get to wer. Then, the
small ring is mo ved fr om the middle to the tar get.
5.c.To solve, the two-ring solution is used twice, and ther e is one e xtra step to mo ve the biggest ring fr om
the sour ce to the tar get. Each solution of two rings r equir es thr ee steps each. So 3 + 1 + 3 = 7 steps total.
6.a.The four-ring pr oblem uses the thr ee-ring solution twice. The thr ee smaller rings ar e mo ved to the396
Access for fr ee at openstax.or g
middle to wer, taking se ven steps as in question 2. One step is needed to mo ve the biggest ring fr om the
sour ce to the tar get. It takes se ven mor e steps mo ve thr ee smaller rings fr om the middle to the tar get. The
total is 7 + 1 + 7 = 15 steps.
12.2 Simple math r ecursion
1.The summation can be calculated using r ecursion because ther e is a r egular pattern and the summation
tondepends on the summation to n -1.
2.Each number in the sequence can be found b y adding 2 to the pr evious number , with the solution at 1
being 1.
3.A prime number does not depend on a smaller prime number; thus, no r ecursion can be found to
gener ate ne w prime numbers based on an e xisting list of prime numbers.
4.A given number in the Fibonacci sequence is found b y summing the pr evious two numbers in the
sequence, so the Fibonacci sequence can be found r ecursively .
5.c.Ther e is a missing base case, so ther e is no place for the r ecursion to end.
6.b.This definition of rec_fact() uses a base case of n ==0, which works because, just like 1!,0! =1.
However, the base case of n ==0returns n, which at this stage is 0, and ther efore zer oes out the r est of
the computation.
7.a.The r ecursive function begins r eturning corr ectly at the base case of n ==0.0! =1.
8.b.The base case of n ==1is not used in the function. When nis0, the o verall multiplication becomes 0
. The r ecursion begins r eturning once the n <0base case is r eached, initially r eturning -1. But the
previous r ecursive call would r eturn 0, ther eby zer oing out all computations and leaving an o verall result
of0.
12.3 Recursion with strings and lists
1.b.Once changed to all lo wer case, the wor d"madam" is a palindr ome, so the function will r ecognize the
word as a palindr ome.
2.a.When a palindr ome has an e ven number of letters, e ventually an empty string is left as pairs of letters
are remo ved. Thus, the base case should include len(word) == 0, which is r esolved with the condition
len(word) <= 1.
3.b.The strip()function r emo ves a given letter fr om the beginning and end of the string, including
repeated letters. When strip('m')is used with "madamm" , the r esultant string is "ada".
4.a.Both lists have the same items in a differ ent or der.
5.b.The two lists have four o verlapping items, but list_num has an e xtra 15, and other_list has an e xtra
22.
6.a.Both lists have the same items in a differ ent or der. The function works for items of any type.
7.a.Both lists have the same items in a differ ent or der. The function works for items of any type, including
other lists.
8.a.Both lists have the same items in the same or der.
12.4 Mor e math r ecursion
1.c.fib(9)=fib(8)+fib(7).fib(9)= fib(8) + fib( 7) =21+13=34.
2.c.Ther e are eight calls to base cases as seen in the animation. Those calls r esult in the r ecursion r eturning
and the final value being computed.
3.b.The structur e that sho ws which function calls ar e made is called a r ecursion tr ee. A r ecursion tr ee can be
used to tr ace ho w the final values ar e computed.
4.c.5*3=15and 5*7=35, so5is a the gr eatest common divisor of 15and 35.
5.a.The first call gcd(24,30)results in 30-24=6, so the ne xt call is gcd(24,6). Ther eafter , other
calls ar egcd(18,6),gcd(12,6), and gcd (6,6)for a total of four r ecursive calls after the initial
function call.397
6.b.When the two numbers have no common divisors, the GCD is 1.
7.b.The first call gcd(13,23)results in 23-13=10, so the ne xt call is gcd(13,10). Ther eafter , other
calls ar egcd(10,3),gcd(7,3),gcd (4,3),gcd(3,2),gcd(2,1), and gcd(1,1)for a total of eight
calls.
12.5 Using r ecursion to solve pr oblems
1.c.This arr ay is sorted in ascending or der, as is r equir ed for using the binary sear ch algorithm.
2.a.mid = (4+7) //2=11//2=5. The oper ator // is used for floor division.
3.a.The first call r esults in midbeing 3, nextmidbecomes 5, and finally ,midbecomes 4. The element
found at inde x 4 is equal to the ke y16.
4.a.The first call r esults in midbeing (0+13) //2=6. The ne xt call has mid (7+13) //2=10.
The ne xt call has mid (11+13) //2=12. At this point, 86<99, so the final call is to mid11, after
which ther e is no wher e else to go.
5.b.As seen in the code e xample for thr ee rings, the solution r equir es se ven steps. The se ven steps ar e
called twice, along with one additional step, for a total of 2 x 7 + 1 = 15.
6.a.The iter ative solution to Thr ee Towers r equir es significantly mor e code and uses additional
programming capabilities.

13.1 Inheritance basics
1.a.A doughnut is a type of pastry , soDoughnut inherits fr omPastry.
2.b.A kitchen has a fr eezer, so a Kitchenclass would contain a Freezerinstance. A has-a r elationship is
also called a composition.
3.b.The Goalkeeper class inherits fr om the Playerclass.
4.b.The subclass name is follo wed b y the super class name in par entheses.
5.a.Deriving CarryOnfromLuggageis specified in CarryOn's class definition. Ex: class
CarryOn(Luggage):. Instances of a subclass, like CarryOn, are created like other classes and do not
requir e the base class name.
6.c.ASubClass instance has access to func_1() , inherited fr omSuperClass , as well as to func_2() , a
SubClass method.
7.a.ASuperClass instance has access to SuperClass 'sfunc_1() but doesn 't have access to anything in
SubClass , including func_2() .
13.2 Attribute access
1.b.dev_1is the second Employee created. So dev_1is the second object to call Employee .__init__() ,
and dev_1.e_id is assigned with 2.
2.a.SubClass 's__init__() is not e xplicitly defined, so SuperClass 's__init__() is executed.
3.b.dc_1inherits feat_1and feat_2fromSuperClass .
4.b.dev_display() is aDeveloper method that accesses dev_1's instance attribute lang_xp.
5.c.dev_display() is aDeveloper method. emp_1is not a Developer instance, so emp_1cannot access
dev_display() .
6.a.Instance attributes inherited fr omEmployee , the super class, ar e accessed the same way as the subclass
Develope r's instance attributes.
13.3 Methods
1.b.Overriding involves defining a subclass method that has the same name as the super class method.
2.b.The self par ameter is missing fr om the o verridden method' s definition.
3.c.The class definition doesn 't indicate inheritance. The definition should be class ContractTax(Tax): .398
Access for fr ee at openstax.or g
4.b.Square's super class is Rectangle .Rectangle 's__init__() is called on line 6.
5.a.super().__init__(4) calls the __init__() ofRectangle' s super class, Polygon. Contr ol mo ves to
line 3, and num_sides is initialized with 4.
6.b.The instance attribute side is initialized with 5.
7.b.Rectangle 's__init__() always calls Polygon's__init__() with num_sides= 4.
8.c.Polymorphism allo wsprint_type() to be o verridden in subclasses of Polygon.
9.a.The * oper ator can be used with integer oper ands as well as strings and other types.
13.4 Hier archical inheritance
1.a.Class Ais the super class for Class Band Class C.
2.b.Emplo yee would be an appr opriate super class for Developer and SalesRep .Developer and
SalesRep are not dir ectly r elated.
3.a.B(2)resolves to B(2, 0), as b_attrhas a default value of 0.a_attris assigned with 2.
4.b.c_insthas access to C's instance attribute, c_attr, as well the inherited attribute fr omA,a_attr.
5.b.D, which inherits fr omB, sod_instinherits b_attr.Balso inherits fr omA, sod_instinherits d_attr.
13.5 Multiple inheritance and mixin classes
1.a.1is the ar gument passed to C's__init__() fora_attr.
2.b.An ar gument is not passed to C's__init__() forc_attr, soc_attris assigned with the default
value, 20.
3.a.2maps to b_attrinB's__init__() .
4.a.eat()only applies to carnivor ous plants, which Pitcherand VenusFlyTrap represent.
5.b.eat()can be mo ved into a mixin class included in Pitcher's and VenusFlyTrap 's inheritance list.
6.b.Good pr actice is to have a mixin class name end in "Mixin" to identify the class' s purpose. The final
implementation is:
class Plant:
def photosynth(self):
print("Photosynthesizing")
class CarnivMixin:
def eat(self):
print("Eating")
class Rose(Plant):
pass
class Pitcher(Plant, CarnivMixin):
pass
class VenusFlyTrap(Plant, CarnivMixin)
pass
Chapter 14
14.1 Reading fr om files
1.c.The file is opened and is associated with the fileobj object. Reading fr om the file will be possible using
fileobj.
2.a.The file must e xist in the same folder as the Python file in or der for the file to be opened.399
3.b.Python interpr ets this command as the pr ogrammer trying to print the object details. The object details
are printed. Ex: <_io.TextIOWrapper name= 'newfile.txt' mode='r'encoding= 'cp1252' >.
4.c.The read()function is called on fileobj. The file 's contents will be r ead into file_str .
5.b.The readlines() function is called on fileobj.file_lines is the string list ['Hello world!\n' ,
'How are you?\n' ].
6.a.The readline() function r eads the ne xt line of a file. Since readline() is called right after opening
the file the first line is r ead. The r esulting string "Hello world!" is printed. Note that readline()
includes the '\n'char acter so the print will include an additional ne wline.
14.2 Writing to files
1.a.The default mode for the open()function is r ead.
2.c.'a'indicates append mode allo wing additions to the file.
3.b.'w'indicates write mode, and newlog.txt will be cr eated or o verwritten (if newlog.txt already e xists)
and will allo w writing.
4.c.resour ces.txt is likely empty , but the state of resour ces.txt is uncertain. T o ensur e the contents ar e saved
correctly , the close()function must be used.
5.a.Write mode will o verwrite the e xisting file. The close()statement finalizes changes to the file.
6.b.Append mode adds to the e xisting file. resour ces.txt is opened such that additions can be made to the
file.
14.3 Files in differ ent locations and working with CSV files
1.b.The path follo wed b y the filename enables the file to be opened corr ectly and in r ead mode b y default.
2.c.The use of forwar d slashes / r eplacing the Windo ws standar d backslashes \ enables the path to be r ead
correctly . The path follo wed b y the filename enables the file to be opened and when r eading a file r ead
mode is pr eferable.
3.c.The file is cr eated or o verwritten and changes can be written into the file.
4.a.Since the backslashes in the Windo ws path appear in the string ar gument, which usually tells Python
that this is part of an escape sequence, the backslashes must be ignor ed using an additional backslash \
char acter .
5.a.The ne wline \nchar acter indicates wher e line br eaks ar e in a file and is used b y the readlines()
function to tell lines apart.
6.b.The cell at the 2nd r ow and 3r d column contains '268'.
7.c.The first line of the books.csv is read into csv_read . The first line is 'Title, Author, Pages' , which
is the same as the first r ow.
14.4 Handling e xceptions
1.c.The string "3-4"is not an integer , so the int()function r aises a ValueError like befor e.
2.a.The filename should end with .txt, not .text.
3.b.If the line has no spaces, then len(parts)will be only 1,and parts[1]will be out of r ange.
4.b.The int()function r aises a ValueError when trying to convert "one"to an integer , so the pr ogram
jumps to the e xcept clause.
5.c.The pr ogram cr ashes and displays this err or because the e xcept clause does not handle ValueError .
6.b.If an e xcept clause does not specify a specific err or type, then any err or type is handled.
14.5 Raising e xceptions
1.a."M"is a valid size, so the Pizzaobject is constructed.
2.c.PizzaError is not a built-in e xception type.
3.a.An e xception can be r aised without pr oviding an err or message. In this case, the err or message is
empty , but the e xception name is still printed.400
