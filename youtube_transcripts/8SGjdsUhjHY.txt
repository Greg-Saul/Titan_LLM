Hello computer science 1010 students and
welcome to week five
I wanted to First remind you that if you
have not taken the chapter one two exam
you need to take that this week before
it closes on Wednesday I'll try and
grade them as soon as I can after that
so you'll get your grade
uh this week we will be finishing up
chapter three
there's a few more sections in chapter
three and then we're just gonna practice
we're gonna practice
by finishing up the Revel for this
chapter and also doing a more involved
programming assignment so I want to warn
you this programming assignment might
take you a little bit longer than some
of the previous programming assignments
so don't put it off until the weekend
start working on it this week the
reading assignment is less so you should
have more time to uh to get to the
programming assignment and then next
week we will be reviewing chapter three
and getting ready to take an exam on
chapter three from here on out we're
just going to take an exam for every
chapter we're not I'm not going to wait
and do uh uh do multiple Chapters at a
time anymore so we'll take a chapter
three exam when we finish chapter three
we'll take a chapter four exam when we
finish chapter four
Etc
uh for the participation this week you
can uh you you will participate in the
Forum in some way so what that means is
either asking or answering a question
um I've had this come up where a student
says well I don't feel like I can answer
any questions and I don't really have
any questions how do I participate in
the Forum well a great way to
participate in the Forum is to start a
thread about one of the the Revel
exercises which I think you are now
finding are some of them are quite
tricky right especially like the
directions are weird and sometimes the
hints the so-called hints that they give
you are not really all that helpful in
being able to find the answer
so I really want you to I still want you
to work through them you know get as
much of the practice aspect as you can
out of the Rebel exercises
and just a reminder I'm not using the
raw score that you're getting in Pearson
so if if you if there's questions you
don't ever figure out or you know you're
and and uh
you know you've tried and tried and you
can't get the answer right in a in a
quiz or there's a checkpoint that you
just don't understand that is not what
the Revel should be about in my opinion
Rebel should be about having some uh
some questions to try and answer and if
there's one that you can't get well then
it's time to start collaborating in the
week five Forum right and see if you can
work together as a group to figure out
these Revel problems because a lot of
times the
um the truth is you're just not
following the directions as closely as
as they were given now of course there I
I believe that there have been some
Rebel exercises already that have come
up that I just you know the the um
directions are not very good the
directions could have been a lot better
but a lot of these that I've seen
complaints about are just you're just
not following the directions so you just
need to read the directions really
carefully parse through them make sure
you understand every line of the
directions and then see if you can do
what they're asking you to do and I
think you'll find that you have more
success with that but
if you still don't know what to
contribute to the week 5 forum maybe
choose one of those Rebel exercises that
took you a couple of tries before you
got it and put in a hint about that
exercise either a checkpoint or a quiz
question it helps if you make the um if
you when you go if you go to the Forum
let's see if I can open up the Forum if
I add a new discussion topic and I put
at the top you know quiz
3.5 quiz question something so the
header tells me where where I am exactly
in the Revel right so I would suggest
doing that so that all of the discussion
about a particular problem can be put in
the in the same spot
okay but that's kind of what I want
these forums to be used for and I'll pop
in if I can during the week and take a
look
um but this is a way you guys can work
together
and try and get all of the Revel
exercises figured out even the tricky
ones
because I do think they're worth doing
all right I hope everybody has a great
week five
