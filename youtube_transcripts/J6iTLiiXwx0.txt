okay danielle i was going to show you
this whole process so i'm going to open
up idle
which is uh your python environment
okay so you've been doing everything in
the shell this is the shell
right and you can you can type your
python commands that's you know it's
super handy for trying out
little stuff like we've been doing so
far
um
and then you know use it in a print
right and that sort of thing but what
you
ultimately want to do and be able to
turn into me is something you're going
to get by going to the file menu
and we're going to type new file
and this is this is now an editor right
where i'm going to type in my python
commands
equals five
cost equals i'm just making up some
numbers here and i'm going to do a print
statement here
okay so these are all individual
commands
now i'm going to save this and this is
where we're going to save the dot py
file
save
and i'm gonna try and remember where
i've saved it to you know so maybe i'll
just put it on the desktop for now
this is gonna be a
test program
and it's automatically going to save it
as a dot py file i'll show you in a
second here
all right now from here i can run all of
i can run all of these commands all at
once
and it's going to
the the output the print is going to
show up in back in the shell window
okay so that's kind of how i want you to
start operating so that you can put you
know all of your
all of your program into this py file
which
i'll show you is now
should be on my desktop
we'll see if we can find it here
let's see i got a lot of crap on my
desktop it looks like
right now
but we will go looking for that
oops
for that dot py file
um
what did we call it
oh now i'm perplexed because i don't see
it here
and it should be on the desktop let's
see where did i save this
uh user is grooner desktop yeah it
should be there
let's see
ah there it is
i'm not exactly sure how stuff is being
arranged on my desktop so i i was
looking for it in alphabetical order and
i don't think things are
necessarily in alphabetical order maybe
opposite l no not even opposite i don't
know how things are being arranged but
anyway if it was a snake you know if it
was a python it would have bit me right
it's sitting right here so this is what
you would drag into your email and send
me and then i could run it just the same
way
um i just ran
that in fact i might go ahead and send
you this program so that you can run it
on your own machine
