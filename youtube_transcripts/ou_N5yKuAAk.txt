hi Lucas is your code let's just let me
just show you a couple of test cases
here that I want you to think about when
you're revising
um let's just let's do a name that's not
Jack or Jill
um okay if I do 11 inch pizza which is
not one of the things
um it tells me I'm gonna get a 12 inch
pizza
and a hand toss crust and then
none of all of these toppings
okay
um and my final cost is zero that
doesn't seem right
do another one
so John's and
um we'll do a 14 inch pizza
and I'm gonna make a mistake and hit a j
for my press selection
and
okay
um so I get J crust
which is definitely not how we want the
program to work right we want the
program to be able to detect when um we
haven't had one of the
options and be able to change it to hand
tossed so that is not happening in this
program
