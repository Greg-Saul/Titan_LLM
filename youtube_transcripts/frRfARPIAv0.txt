okay in this video let's take a look at
downloading installing the thawney ide
for use here so i'm just going to search
for
bonnie
and uh we're looking for thawney.org so
go ahead and go up and oh this is a
window system by the way
so i'm going to download the windows
version
and we can see it's starting to download
down here
and then let's go ahead and open it up
oops
i think i downloaded it
twice we're only gonna need one of those
okay and i'm on a school computer
so i'm gonna just install for me and
that's probably what you're gonna do too
if you
if you have if you have that choice
and then we're going to go through all
the license stuff
and this is where it's going to install
it is into this path and i would just
let it go ahead and install to where it
wants to install
okay oh and then it's going to
it's going to make a
shortcut in the start menu that's that's
a good thing too right
and if you want it to put an icon on the
desktop you'll need to click on that
okay
so now we're going to go through the
process here
and the progress bar is just going to
show us
how we're doing
okay and then we finally get done and we
get the message that we've we've done it
okay so now
let's see if i click this away if we'll
see on the
um
there's my icon on the desktop
and also if i go down to the start menu
which i think you you can't see in this
view in this video but it's the it's the
windows menu at the bottom
um
it's going to be under recently added
and it should also be
alphabetically
yeah
i'm sure that's gonna work yeah there it
is okay so we can get to it
from one of those ways and we'll just
open it up here and
do a quick demo to make sure it's
working
it's kind of tiny isn't it
let's make that window a little bigger
huh
and we will do a little print
hello world and this should prompt me to
save this because i'm doing it in the
file
way so let's see let's
save this
in
[Music]
this file
okay
this is my hello world program
because that's what it does all right
and then when we ran it we get the hello
world i can also use the script
and just see this line of code run this
print statement that we're gonna talk
more about in future videos
