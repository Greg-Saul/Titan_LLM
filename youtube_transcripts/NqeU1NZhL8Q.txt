all right let's attempt to download and
install the thawney
ide on a
mac
okay so i'm going to just search for
thoni ide and here it comes up at
funny.org
we'll click on it and we want the mac
version since i'm doing this on my mac
it's going to download
and then i had to be able to click on it
right there
you can't see the side but i'm getting a
little um
icon that's bouncing around
and
i'm just going to click through these
okay
all right
put in your password
i'll pause this while i'm waiting well
actually i think it's going to finish
really fast it's going to
take less than a minute
so pretty straightforward
okay so i did pause the video and then i
finally got the message that the
installation was successful so that is
good and then i can move the installer
to the trash because we don't need it
anymore um and now i'm gonna go
up to the top here and
search for it
see if i can find it
um
[Music]
because where did it install it to
that's the question you have to ask
are we going to be able to find it again
let's see yeah
okay so at this point i'm kind of um i'm
kind of
a little dismayed actually that we can't
get to it from the
little magnifying glass guy um so i'm
going to go looking for it with the
finder window
all right so
let's go to applications because that's
usually where stuff gets installed too
and here it is
there it is and i'm gonna open it up and
see if it'll double click on it and
um let's see okay first time so english
yes
standard settings
good and this definitely looks like the
bonnie environment
and
we'll do a quick
hello world program to test it
maybe do one from the shell also so i'm
just gonna do
hey
on this one yes good
and we'll save this program someplace
and
see if we can
let's see do we want to put it there
i'm gonna put it on the desktop
i think i'm gonna make a new folder
for python files huh
okay and let's call this a test
test program one
okay so this test program one
and i can run it and there it goes
running in the uh
the shell window
okay so i am going to attempt to restart
my machine
which means i'll have to stop the
recording and just see if i can actually
use the magnifying glass to search for
it because i think that's a little bit
of a pain
that you can't do that
