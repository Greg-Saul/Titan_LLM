yeah okay so I think this program will
make a lot more sense after you've seen
a demonstration of it that it will
come it'll come together okay so in my
program I have a Max X of 500 and a Max
y of 500 also
here's here's a sample run just so you
can kind of see what an output is going
to look like I've got my box set up so
that it's going to go so this is zero
zero at the center and I've drawn a line
that goes from minus
Max X and a y coordinate of 0
to Max X and a y coordinate of 0 and
then I've done uh on the on the x equals
zero axis go from y of Max y to
minus Max y
right and just to point something out it
will do
put that leading zero it does it you
know this is this is an operator also so
you can make this into minus 500. a good
thing to know
so let me run the program here once so
you can just kind of see what's
I'm envisioning to happen here so here's
the prompt for color number one let's
make it red
and color number two I'll make it blue
and then I'm gonna do an X location
let's do something in quadrant one so
that's going to be two positive numbers
let's do 300
and
uh 100.
yeah and a radius of 50.
okay so now we're going to draw the
stuff here I'm drawing my box that shows
the limit of the max x max y
M the zero zero coordinates just for my
own reference
and then my two circles so one of them's
at centered at 300
and uh in the X so this is 300X which
makes sense right because this is 500
and this is zero so 300 should be a
little past the center right and 100
should be about a fifth of a way up
right since this is 500 in the in the X
Direction and because I entered red and
blue for my colors
that means that the color of this should
be purple
the if the first color is purple the
second color should be orange so the
second circle is orange and the second
circle is basically reflected across the
y-axis so if I I mean across the x-axis
so if I was to fold this
in in half right here along the X that's
where the new circle is going to be on
the Y
that makes sense
um so let's do another and we'll put it
in we'll put the next circle into the
fourth quadrant here and it should we
want it to reflect to the third quadrant
so we'll cross the the y-axis and run it
again
all right let's try a different color
combo how about yellow
and blue
and we'll try an X location it's got to
be a positive negative X because it's
going to be in the fourth quadrant so
let's make it negative 400
and a y location
[Music]
it's also
oops I've already messed this up okay
let me stop and run again sorry
running again okay so same color as
yellow
and blue X location is positive in
quadrant four so let's make it positive
400 all the way over toward the edge
the right edge here and the Y is going
to be let's make it minus 200.
okay so Envision where that's going to
be on the graph
and then let's make the radius 50.
okay so now we're going to do our
drawing here based on those
Max X and Max y
being drawn here's the first Circle over
at 400
and the second circle is going to be
minus 400 right
because if the first X location is 400
the second X location should be minus
400 then we drew our Circle and if the
first color is green then the second
color is going to be purple
all right let me do one where it's
outside the boundaries here so let's run
it one more time
okay let's choose this time what haven't
we done yet let's do
red and
yellow
so we should get orange for our first
color and our X location let's choose
500 let's go to 490.
um and then oy location that is
[Music]
30.
okay and the radius is going to be let's
make it 50.
so let's make it 100 make a bigger
Circle
okay now we're going to draw our grid
[Music]
and then
um we get a little we get a a message
here that the it should be fit of course
not fixed now that Circle will not fit
in the X Direction it's going to go
outside the boundaries
of on the X side
right and so we'll let the one that that
flips over the x-axis so these circles
in this case because the the um they're
bigger circles right and they're they're
close together on the y-axis they're
going to overlap
that's okay but I do want this message
to get printed out I want you to do the
test to find out whether or not this
circle is going to fit with inside this
grid this Max x max y grid and let us
know if it doesn't fit in one or both
directions
okay I hope that gives you a little bit
more insight into understanding how this
program should work
